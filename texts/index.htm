<div class="update"><strong>Updated April 23, 2005:</strong>The first update on the website's new home. Nifty, huh? And to celebrate that, I've added a brand new page for the site: <a href="builder.htm">Bob The Builder</a>! No, it's not a Random Rambling&trade;. Did you know they released a Bob The Builder album? Well, that's the one I'm reviewing. Do check it out! Also, I added the two final <a href="kraftwerk.htm">Kraftwerk</a> reviews: <strong>Electric Cafe</strong> and <strong>Tour De France Soundtracks</strong>. There will be more reviews coming up shortly, so be patient. Enjoy these for now!</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="update"><strong>Updated May 8, 2005:</strong> If you're using Mozilla Firefox, you may have noticed a small orange icon on the bottom right corner of the window. What's that, you ask? It's an RSS Feed, a nifty thing the marvellous world of the Internet offers us. If you click that icon and add a bookmark, you can follow the site's updates without having to open up the entire site! Nifty, eh? I don't know if you'll care much about it, as it was more an experiment than a serious attempt at something. And now, there <em>will</em> be an update listed there... the brand new <a href="cranberries.htm">Cranberries page</a>! All five albums are reviewed.<br>
By the way, I have to say I'm very unhappy with my rating system as it is now. I'll definitely make a fairly large reformulation on the site in a near future, maybe add a new feature or two. Of course, I'll keep writing new reviews whenever I can. My days have been quite busy recently, and my main stress relief has been the Playstation game Harvest Moon: Back To Nature, but I'll do what I can. Remember, whenever there's something new on the page, you can check out the RSS Feed very, very quickly! Isn't that, like, NIFTY?</div>

<p>Howdy! Fernie Canto speakin'. This is my humble Album Reviews page, proud member of the Web Reviewing Comunity, and I invite you to join me in an exciting, unpredictable and totally insane journey through music, both well known <em>and</em> barely known. You won't find 1700+ reviewed items on here, but you will find things that you can't find in any other reviews website. So enjoy your stay, and if you are not offended by sudden bursts of self-importance <em>and</em> sudden bursts of swearing and cursing, feel free to navigate through the links below.</p>

<p>Remember, the address to my reviews page is now <a href="http://sirmustapha.mylimbo.net">sirmustapha.mylimbo.net</a>, so update your bookmarks! The site is being kindly hosted by Adam Hollett, and not Geocities anymore. Don't forget to pay a visit to Adam's own site, <a href="http://mylimbo.net">mylimbo.net</a>, and check out the nifty stuff in there.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> My e-mail address has changed. Now, all comments should be sent to <a href="mailto: sirmustapha@gmail.com">sirmustapha@gmail.com</a>. I suppose I should use some of those sneaky techniques to avoid spam bots, especially now that I got a brand new account, but I don't know if it does much good, anyway.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, big thanks to the people who have sent me kind, uplifting messages, and have been appreciating my work here. We're having new, kickass reviewer comments coming on. If you have any comments about the albums I reviewed here, or about the reviews themselves, or about my own music (*wink wink*), mail me! It's <em>always</em> nice to receive reader comments.</p>

<p><a href="me.htm"><img src="images/therealme.png" alt="About me" /></a> - A Q&amp;A style page about the owner of this website.</p>

<p><a href="mailto:sirmustapha@gmail.com"><img src="images/tellmewhy.png" alt="Mail me" /></a> - If you have any comments about the artists and albums I have reviewed, be sure to <a href="mailto:sirmustapha@gmail.com">mail me</a> your ideas, and they will be added to the page with as little delay as possible!</p>

<p><a href="ratings.htm"><img src="images/itssoobvious.png" alt="The ratings system" /></a> - A detailed explanation about the rating system, and a list of reviewed albums.</p>

<p><a href="links.htm"><img src="images/peoplelikeus.png" alt="Links" /></a> - The mandatory links page, related and non-related to music.</p>

<p><a href="http://ferniecanto.imdanet.com/"><img src="images/mysticrhythms.png" alt="Fernie's Music" /></a> - Quickly! Come in fast into my music page and download my latest album, <strong>Concerto Schizophrenia II: "Buses"</strong>! It is available for free download, along with my two previous albums, <strong>Musics For Highways</strong> and <strong>The Binary Sounds Of Nature</strong>! Give them a listen if you're interested in instrumental music. People say the music is good!</p>

<p><a href="random1.htm"><img src="images/rambleon.png" alt="Random Ramblings" /></a> - This is the NEW SECTION on my site: Random Ramblings&trade;!! Because I'm such a talkative and deep person, I have reserved this space for several things I might want to talk about. For now, there is only one page in the section, but more are bound to come! So, before it's too late, come and check my first Random Rambling&trade;: <a href="random1.htm">"Give Me Back My Name!" The Adventures Of Ferny Canto</a>, about the wonders of a cartoon called <em>Jakers! The Adventures Of Piggley Winks</em>. Curious already? No? Oh, well.</p>
