Queen
<p>I must say: I love Queen. Not in the "Wow, Queen are so great, they are the bestest band ever" way, but as in... these guys have a very special place in my heart. Believe it or not, it was through Queen that I got seriously into rock music, and that really changed my life. Maybe I don't love this band today as much as I once loved it, but I still love Queen, and that's a fact.</p>

<p>Having said that, I have to try to be neutral on this one: Queen are one of those bands that manage to be both overrated and underrated. Yeah, you know: Queen is one of the "greats", and they have their more than fair share of ultra-devoted fans. I mean, they're <em>Queen</em>, you know? They recorded [s]We Are the Champions[/s], you know? [s]Bohemian Rhapsody[/s], you know? Around the world you'll find quite a load of people who put them among the best bands in the world. But also because of that hugeness, and the hugeness of a handful of songs (such as the aforementioned two, among with [s]We Will Rock You[/s], [s]Another One Bites the Dust[/s] and so on), many people tend to neglect Queen. Certain groups dislike Queen more than they should, dismissing them as some campy "glam" band, as a mere vehicle for lead singer Freddie Mercury's flamboyant antics, or as &mdash; gasp! &mdash; a "one hit wonder" or some crap like that. So, the band is simultaneously worshipped and despised on the account of the same few songs. But who <em>truly</em> knows Queen, and all the nooks and crannies of their catalogue?</p>

<p>Well, I am not an addict and I am not some insane completist who is trying to find every obscure and rare song the band ever put out. I stick to their albums and maybe a few B-sides and such, but yeah, I know virtually all of their songs by heart. This band is unique, and you will find nothing like them anywhere else. No, I'm not going as far as the most crazed fans to say that Queen is absolutely incomparable: they had many influences and they were not alone in the world. But the blend of styles, of talents and interests made this band something truly out of the ordinary. Everyone rants and raves about the qualities of Freddie Mercury and his voice; I mean, he <em>was</em> an icon and he surely <em>enjoyed</em> being an icon, but at the same time he always made it clear that he was not the "leader" of the band in any way. Of course, not many people care, but if you give a close listen, you will clearly hear that the band worked as a unit, be it in the writing, be it in the arrangements, be it in the performances. It's true, Freddie brought in his powerful singing and his intricate compositions and arrangements, but there would be no band if it weren't for the amazing grip of the other band members. Roger Taylor, our favourite blond haired drummer, has a very distinctive and peculiar style with fierce, booming hits, choked cymbals and his iconic combination of snare drum and open hi-hat; John Deacon always made a great use of his bass guitar, always meshing well with his band mates and adding nice, memorable melodic layers to the music; and Brian May, whose guitar skills are even more memorable than his hair, and didn't solely rely on shredding and flashy solos, but invested a lot of effort and time in complex, lush orchestrations and peculiar guitar tones. And that's not to speak about all those vocal harmonies they sprayed all over their songs, reaching absolute extremes as evidenced in the classic [s]Bohemian Rhapsody[/s].</p>

<p>All of this is nicely countered by the songwriting skills of all four members: you've got heavy rocking, pop sensibility, touches of everything from vaudeville to classical music, and the compositional techniques that yielded them labels such as "operatic" and whatnot. Yet, in spite of Brian May's efforts, the band never ever dabbled with prog rock: it is clear, even in Freddie Mercury's most ambitious tracks, that all the complexity and grandiosity is done with tongue firmly in cheek, and whey they go over-the-top, they do so with gusto and on purpose. I have no doubts that Queen could have <em>easily</em> pulled off a genuine progressive rock album, but they refused to do it, and went so far as to proudly state in their liner notes that no synthesizers were used in their first seven records (until they broke the taboo, in radical fashion, with their 1980 album [a]The Game[/a]). And I guess it's slightly easier to talk about the things Queen were <em>not</em> than the things they <em>were</em>, or at least to sum it up in a few paragraphs. The only way to dive into this band is to go in depth into their albums. And that's what we're here for, right?</p>

1973
[s]Great King Rat[/s], [s]Keep Yourself Alive[/s], [s]My Fairy King[/s]
<p>In their first LP, Queen gathered up songs they wrote over three years. And, like most "humble beginnings" of famous bands, the album doesn't sound like their "classic" sound. If you are used to the "operatic" song format, with millions of vocal harmonies everywhere, loud pianos and guitar harmonies, be aware that this album only brings a <em>tiny bit</em> of those influences. The title "humble beginning" is not at all exaggerated for this band: the quartet managed to record their first demo tracks only because of an agreement with the De Lane Lea Studios, in which they'd test the studio equipments in exchange for some studio time to record their own material. With the ensuing demo tape, though, the only secured a deal with Trident Studios, recording very late at night when the studio was closed. Production standards are remarkably low &mdash; it's not abysmal or anything, but the sound is very muffled and muddy, in spite of the best efforts of producer Roy Thomas Baker and engineer Mike Stone. The recording process was plagued with difficulties, so much that the version of [s]The Night Comes Down[/s] you hear here is the original demo, because all attempts at rerecording them failed.</p>

<p>As for the songs themselves, they can be separated into the "more complex" ones and into the "more simple" ones; as much as I hate separations, anyway. None of those 10 songs ever became a truly smash hit, and that's a shame, because several songs on here are quite standouts. [s]Keep Yourself Alive[/s] was a minor hit, and deservedly so. Brian May combines an almost moronic one-note guitar rhythm with some absolutely smart guitar work and an upbeat pop melody, while the band keeps peppering the tune with untrivial instrumental breaks. Brian is already exposing his strange guitar sounds (remember, "nobody played synthesizer") already, and a taste for multi guitar layers, too. Still, this is more like a great pop song rather than an "absolute Queen masterpiece", even if I think it deserved more attention than it got. Meanwhile, his [s]Son and Daughter[/s] is a stab at that slow, murky, bass-driven heavy metal sound, with a cool, groovy riff, and an awesome use of vocal harmonies in that "I! WANT! YO-OU! To be a woman!" You don't see things like that everyday, you know. I like the song, mostly because of those guitar tricks Brian keeps throwing, mostly in the coda, because the composition itself isn't a stand-out, neither for 1973 nor for today's standards.</p>

<p>Other tunes are also quite nice. [s]The Night Comes Down[/s] is this pleasant little acoustic-guitar-driven ballad that begins and ends with a spooky guitar line going up and down, and [s]Doing All Right[/s] (a very old tune from the time when Brian and Roger had a band called Smile with Tim Staffel, who shared writing credits in this track) keeps changing from a little piano ballad into a power-chord fast heavy rocker. As for Roger Taylor's first composition, [s]Modern Times Rock 'n' Roll[/s], it's a short fast rocker that I would call a parody on Punk Rock if Punk Rock already existed in 1973. It's almost <em>bold</em> in its utter dumbness, but it features a neat guitar riff, some mean soloing and a really fast rhythm. And it's short.</p>

<p>About the "more complex" songs? Well, coincidence or not, they're all Freddie Mercury compositions. Of course, they're what you can call "embryonic" Freddie Mercury compositions, but that doesn't mean they're worse, only different: they are great, and majorly fun. Oddly enough, I was always kind of cold towards [s]Liar[/s], but I enjoy it now. After all, it's one of the very, very few instances of a Mercury song sounding <em>bluesy</em>, and he plays a Hammong organ in it! I may be incorrect here, but I don't think they used an organ in <em>any</em> other song they recorded. It's the lengthiest song here, and it goes through all sorts of sections, vocal melodies, solos, call-and-response parts and anything Freddie could cram into the song. I particularly like the part when it turns <em>really</em> hard and groovy more or less halfway through. Very, very cool playing, especially when John bashes those loud, distorted bass notes. The other two are brilliant: [s]Great King Rat[/s] is the best of them, incredibly entertaining with its upbeat, marching rhythm, frenetic rapid-fire singing, brilliant guitar solos and a very intelligent structure that doesn't reach out to be "complex" for no reason. It flows very seamlessly and naturally. [s]My Fairy King[/s] pushes into a more dramatic territory, switching between fast and slow, quiet and loud as fast as a blink of the eye. And it's gorgeous, with the lyrics hitting the "fantasy" level, but not sounding really annoying. You can't be bothered to nitpick on Freddie's lyrics, when he's playing like a madman on the piano and weaving vocal overdubs over vocal overdubs like there's no tomorrow. My favourite part is Freddie's piano solo part near the end, and the way it takes off into a tense, heart-wrenching build-up towards a not so climatic end. Beautiful stuff.</p>

<p>There's also the novelty 'Jesus', a gospel-like song that's way too annoying to my tastes, and completely overdoes the loud, hard-rockin' middle break. Dunno, I just never liked it too much, and unlike [s]Liar[/s], it never grew on me. Oddly enough, the album closes with what would become the band's first big hit in the next album: [s]Seven Seas of Rhye[/s], albeit in the shape of an one-minute instrumental tune. Strange. Either way, don't miss this album if you really are into Queen: it's not at all a disposable album, though it <em>will be</em> extremely unfamiliar if you started out with [a]A Night at the Opera[/a], or even [a]Sheer Heart Attack[/a]. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, shall we? Do get this album, but don't expect a masterpiece: it's a hell of a mixed bag and a hell of a patchy album. But it's a <em>fun</em> kind of "patchy", if you know what I mean.</p>

Queen II
1974
[s]Father to Son[/s], [s]Ogre Battle[/s], [s]The March of the Black Queen[/s], [s]White Queen (As It Began)[/s]
<p>This album here gives you the clear idea that Queen, at this moment, didn't know <em>exactly</em> which way to go. In one hand, they had the "complex" approach of Freddie Mercury, and in the other hand, they had the "dark rockin'" approach of Brian May. As a result, this album is divided in two: the "white side", almost completely written by Brian, and the "black side", entirely written by Freddie Mercury. This might have not been the most intelligent decision they ever did, but the final result happens to be my favourite Queen album ever.</p>

<p>Be aware that this is not a great Queen album in the "classic" sense: it has only a single true hit single (incidentally their first ever), and it is still quite different from what Queen would shortly become. The band isn't focusing their skills into something specific, and as a result, the album can sound a bit messy and hodge-podgey for some people. But for me, however, this is the most proverbially <em>perfect</em> Queen album in existence. The style here isn't very much different from [a]Queen[/a], but the band polishes their playing and songwriting skills quite a lot, and their music actually gains a <em>dark</em> quality that you'll never hear anywhere else. Plus, saying the production is improved is one major understatement. Also, I think it was nice to give more liberty to the two major songwriters in the band: with a lot of running time in their hand, Brian and Freddie concentrate in writing "mini suites", displaying their unique style and tastes. Freddie bounces and bops everywhere, with his absurdist visions and stories, and all his vocal performances that would make Peter Gabriel proud, while Brian picks up his guitar and blasts out some mean rockers and some dramatic ballads, creating the darkest streak of songs in Queen's entire career. I dunno, but I think Brian's side is far <em>darker</em> than Freddie's side, and so, it should be the Black side, not the White side! Oh, well, that naming probably has to do with the song titles, anyway ([s]White Queen[/s] and [s]March of the Black Queen[/s]).</p>

<p>So, I cannot find any other way to review the album than to talk of the two sides separately. Anyway, side A features <em>another</em> Roger Taylor composition, [s]The Loser in the End[/s]. Mind you, it's easily the weakest track in the record, but it's so retardedly fun and exciting, I can't help loving the guts out of it. Brian blasts out some furious guitar attacks, while Roger bashes the hell out of his drumkit as the song fades out. I love that drumming! But don't try to look for any substantial melody, of course. Just thought I should warn you. Anyway, Brian surely writes some of the best songs in here. To open up the album, he displays his ever increasing skills with creating guitar symphonies in the instrumental [s]Procession[/s] &mdash; a spooky tune that leads into the "magnum opus" of side one, [s]Father to Son[/s]. I'm really, really fond of that little "cascade" guitar riff at the very beginning, not just for the unique, "tingling" guitar sound, but for the effect it causes. But don't let that detail fool you: the song is a mean, dark rocker, with vocal parts that reach out for a poignant, emotional quality, that suddenly collapse into a thunderous, Earth-shattering instrumental break. The dark atmosphere of the song engulfs me completely, and it's a good thing that the atmosphere doesn't go away soon: the acoustic guitar ballad [s]White Queen[/s] is just as dark, and just as beautiful as the previous track. Brian compliments Freddie's singing with an amazing acoustic guitar solo, just before the song builds into the powerful, "electric" instrumental break. Without letting things get too serious, [s]Some Day One Day[/s] breaks the proceedings as a cute, understated yet delightfully boppy pop tune with Brian taking over the vocal duties. I like that little guitar riff, and the strange drum patterns Roger plays. Plus, Brian wastes no efforts to show his guitar multi-layering at the end. Just one really nifty pop song that doesn't feel really pop, you know.</p>

<p>Now, if the fans start complaining that everything's just too slow and boring, I just flip the side and show Freddie's most monstrous creation so far in the band's career: [s]Ogre Battle[/s] will completely rock your world with its fast, furious guitar riff and Roger bashing the drums as if he was the Devil himself. The meticulous vocal work, the cool vocal harmonies, the guitar noisefests and the intro, that's merely the outro played backwards &mdash; man, such a <em>simple</em> trick, how come nobody had ever done that before? &mdash; complete the picture, and in my opinion, this single track whips everything from the debut album. But, being Freddie Mercury and all, he presents [s]The March of the Black Queen[/s], that completely puts [s]Great King Rat[/s] and [s]Liar[/s] to absolute shame. This one is much more clever, exciting and well-written, and I can't help loving every second of its running length to death. Plus, I love that ending! Just as you think everything has just come to an end, with Brian making his guitar hum a funny little melody, the song comes back, and everything runs towards a climatic, grandiose finale! The much shorter [s]The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke[/s] still impresses me with that harpsichord playing, the millions of voices and harmonies coming from every place at the same time, and the piano at the ending that leads us to the gorgeous, spine-tingling short ballad [s]Nevermore[/s]: in one minute, it accomplishes everything that other bands would spend <em>seven</em> minutes trying to accomplish, and that's because Freddie displays a deviously untrivial and beautiful melody along the piano playing. Finally, he shows his ability to come up with short, striking pop songs. Two of them, to be precise: [s]Funny How Love Is[/s] displays thick layers of vocal harmonies, but still manages to be as pure and catchy as a pop song should be, and [s]Seven Seas of Rhye[/s] holds the record for being the band's first big hit, and deservedly so. The song manages to kick serious butt, and all the guitar lines, the constant stop-and-go, and the fast piano line feel perfectly at ease with the simple, catchy vocal melody. Mercury's complicated songcraft skill gets condensed into a single 3 minute product, and it succeeds amazingly at being catchy and entertaining.</p>

<p>This record went down as a "minor release" in the band's catalogue, though less "minor" and less overlooked than the debut. It's not hard to see why, but I still think it's quite a shame. The record is better than many people make it seem, even though it's not as "classic" as latter releases, and only barely indicative of the direction the band would take on the very next record. But do check this one out, eventually; if only for [s]Ogre Battle[/s]. They didn't do rockers as awesome as that one very often, you know.</p>

Sheer Heart Attack
1974
[s]Killer Queen[/s], [s]Brighton Rock[/s]
<p>Heh, just look at that: their <em>third</em> release is the one that seems (<em>seems!</em>) to suffer from the "sophomore slump". And why? Well, because after two solid, brilliant Queen classics, the album goes on a craze and shoots absolutely <em>everywhere</em>, almost at once; Roger Taylor songs stumbling upon hard rockers, short tracks of various styles switching at the blink of an eye, operatic bombast, hard rock trashing, a John Deacon composition... all wrapped up on black fabric, beaten with clubs and then dropped on a large disc of black vinyl. Man, if <em>this</em> isn't a hodgepodge of Queen oddities, then nothing is.</p>

<p>Either way, the main rule here is to wipe out all the "darkness" of their sound, and launch headfirst into the tongue-in-cheekiness that's what would turn into their trademark. And in the process, they take their time to do whatever they feel like doing at a particular time. As such, <em>every</em> new track is a left turn this album takes. You can never quite predict what's coming up next, the first time around. And it helps that the songs are all pretty good, so there aren't those unpleasant surprises, or songs that feel like a bucket of cold water after a warm bath. Unfortunately, the overall level of quality dropped a bit from [a]Queen II[/a]; at least to <em>me</em>, of course. While there are no songs I dislike, it makes less of a consistent, exciting ride. But, well, this is the album that points to the future! A glorious future, that is.</p>

<p>Freddie himself is on a roll, exercising his songwriting muscles nonstop to create a string of excellent and creative songs, most of them already on the operatic vein. The absolute classic here is [s]Killer Queen[/s], which he described as the "essential Queen song", and it's easy to see why: carefully written down to every single note, and showing their skills with vocal overdubs, tricky song structure and all that stuff. And Brian May gets his chance to shine, playing another of his beautiful guitar solos, and those mini guitar-symphonies as well. This song is the ultimate display of the band's prowess at <em>crafting</em> a perfect little pop song: if [s]Father to Son[/s] had the band at their most spontaneous and loose, [s]Killer Queen[/s] is a meticulous, carefully put together studio product, and <em>I love it</em>. The lyrics, as slight as they are here, suddenly become a big asset in the vicious [s]Flick of the Wrist[/s], his scream against the music execs &mdash; a theme yet to be revisited on the next album, but here, it's quite cool already; not so poisonous, but freaky and over-the-top in a way only Freddie himself could sing correctly. Musically, it's hard rock, slow and pounding on the verses, fast on the choruses. Unlike anything on [s]Queen II[/s], though the sound of the track could definitely be boosted up a bit. More guitar, perhaps. The song is closed with the piano ballad [s]Lily of the Valley[/s], with a good melody but nothing that makes it better than [s]Nevermore[/s], for example. And there are the bombastic swells, of course.</p> 

<p>On the more eccentric vein, he brings [s]In the Lap of the Gods[/s], in which Freddie takes "bombastic" as an objective. The intro to the song, which crashes in as loudly as it possibly can, is what I could call a blueprint for [s]Bohemian Rhapsody[/s], but with much more emphasis on comedic exaggeration than in stuffing as many voices as possible in one single strip of tape. And it's great! In particular the mini-orchestra Brian makes with the guitar. Eventually, the opera fest fades away, and turns into something of a romantic ballad, with Freddie's vocals on the wrong speed, and Taylor belting out some screams. The "revisited" version at the end is something else entirely, like the bitter end of the story began on the first version ("My money, that's all you wanna talk about" &mdash; man, that and [s]Flick of the Wrist[/s] on the <em>same</em> album), in which the band pulls the trick of repeating the huge, anthemic, "sing-along" wo-wo-lah-lah-lah chorus over and over and over, until the voices are louder than the speakers can handle, and until there's no more reason to sing the same goddamn chorus, and end with a horribly distorted gong. Some might complain of the band becoming too big for their own sake, but come on, this is a goddamn <em>parody</em>! It's hard to believe that someone would take this song at face value but, believe me, some people ar just like that. Finally, there's the hilarious, hyperactive ragtime [s]Bring Back That Leroy Brown[/s], with Brian playing the <em>banjo</em>, and plenty of vocal interplay. Just brilliant, man.</p>

<p>Yes, that makes six Mercury tracks on the album, almost half of the thing. What I find interesting, however, is that <em>every single</em> of those six tracks feature the piano extensively. This may have to do with Freddie's growing confidence with the instrument, but it also may have something to do with the fact that Brian May fell ill during the initial phase of the recordings, forcing John Deacon to do some of the guitar parts, and giving him confidence to deliver his first composition to the band: [s]Misfire[/s], which is just lovely as hell &mdash; much like most of his output with the band. It's short, but it's groovy and catchy, and features <em>plenty</em> of guitar overdubs, which culminates with two guitar choruses dialoguing with each other at the end. Pretty impressive, I say, even if it's only slightly indicative of the songs he was about to come with. Roger Taylor wrote [s]Tenement Funster[/s], which begins his "teenager problems" trend. It's a pretty cool, slow, acoustic guitar driven (John again!) rock song. His best so far, in fact. The other non-May song is actually credited to the whole group, [s]Stone Cold Crazy[/s], their stab at fast, trashy hard rock. Great riff, very tight playing, and lots of fun. Of course, it sounds like a throwaway considering the band's best output, but if you are not willing to take it seriously, just remember that Metallica made a cover of it. If the grandaddies of trash metal are tipping their hats to it, then it may not be a worthless throwaway after all.</p>

<p>As for Brian May's compositions, one of them is an absolute ace: [s]Brighton Rock[/s], which opens the album, is one of his best moments as a guitarist. The "song" portion of it is absolutely hilarious, with a frenzied, hyperactive rhythm and Freddie throwing out his best vocal intonations to deliver the short story. And then, Brian throws a series of incredible and entertaining guitar solos, which culminates with him using an echo unit so he can play against himself. It's just fabulous how he plays the entire song without ever trying to "show off". It's a big, exciting, stimulating guitar rant. The other songs aren't that good. One of them is the super slight one minute piano lullaby [s]Dear Friends[/s], and another one is the classic, live standard [s]Now I'm Here[/s]. You know, at this stage, it sounds rather generic, but it's <em>still</em> a fine, well written rocker. Crowd pleasing fluff? Well, consider me pleased, then. It's got cool chord progressions! And those high-pitched whistling-like noises that sound synthesized, but the album clearly states, one again, that no synthesizer was played. It's just Brian's guitar again. And for more guitar freakiness, there's the dark-ish ballad [s]She Makes Me[/s], which is pretty strange and beautiful. Brian's vocals are not fantastic, but he does a good job, and the best thing about it is the way Brian holds those weird guitar notes for so long. It's not that I doubt his skill, but it boggles my mind to think he managed that without tape loops or something. Just cool.</p>

<p>I hope I didn't scare anyone with my descriptions of the album as a mess of half-finished songs, because in the end, it doesn't <em>sound</em> like it. Not because it's "accomplished", but because it's <em>fun</em>! This is already a good place to get some of that prime Queen sound, especially if you're one of those who like to follow a band's evolution. Maybe it's not very recommendable for the passing fan, but [s]Brighton Rock[/s] is a song you need, and it's not in their compilations. And if you are into the band, consider this a must-have.</p>

<p>There can hardly be a better instance for a person to see the difference between a <em>patchy</em> album and a <em>diverse</em> album: [a]Sheer Heart Attack[/a] was great, but it sounded like the band was shooting everywhere at once hoping some of the shots would stick. Here, though, they're shooting everywhere at once and they're <em>confident</em> it will all stick. And stick it does! Like hell it does! Basically, this is the place to look if you want to check out all the very, very best things about Queen in one clean, neat package. ... errm, well, there is also [a]Greatest Hits[/a] for that, but if you want to hear the <em>band at work</em>, and not the record label putting out their best selling singles and raking in the cash, yes, <em>this</em> is undoubtedly the place to go.</p>

<p>But what <em>are</em> those good things that you can find here? Say, it's not too far from being an extension of [a]Sheer Heart Attack[a], in terms of material: ragtime, big band, hard rock, opera, music hall, folk, piano balladeering... but everything with a heavy dosage of tongue-in-cheek pomp and self-importance. That, if you wish, is the famous Queen "schtick"; or "gimmick", if you're willing to call it that. I'm not. I just can't think of [s]Seaside Rendezvous[/s], for example, as being the mere product of a "gimmick": it's way more than that! It wouldn't be so genuinely entertaining and invigorating if it were a simple gimmick, right? I'm sorry to bring in the comparisons here, but I am much, much more confident with saying that Paul McCartney was doing a simple gimmick with [s]Rocky Raccoon[/s], while Queen was doing much more in [s]Seaside Rendezvous[/s], as it sounds far more natural, more confident, less self-aware and far more genuinely fun, like Freddie Mercury wasn't expicting the whole world to laugh with him and lick his boots and proclaim him Supreme Leader of the World for All Eternity or something. But that's just talking about style; what about the content? Just to give you an idea, <em>both</em> Roger Taylor and John Deacon contributed one classic song, each. [s]I'm in Love With My Car[/s] is great: Roger finally let go of the "serious issues" of parenting and the emptiness of teenagehood and made a little joke song about being <em>literally</em> in love with one's car, and it rocks pretty heavily. If you're allergic towards Roger's vocals, though, be careful: he pulls all stops here. Meanwhile, John Deacon finally gathered enough confidence to deliver a full blown pop tune, and [s]You're My Best Friend[/s] deservedly became a hit single: it is simple, modest and almost sticky, but Freddie puts his soul into the singing, and the bouncy Wurlitzer riff is probably going to stick to your brain for all eternity. Scary? Well, this is pop music!</p>

<p>But that, folks, is just <em>two</em> songs here. This is the album in which both May 'n' Mercury go berserk, both with their wicked compositions and with their wild lot of overdubs and recording techniques. Check out Brian's [s]Good Company[/s], for example, in which he uses his guitar to simulate a whole horn and woodwind section, backing it all up with an ukelele. His magnum opus, [s]The Prophet's Song[/s], is also impressive, with the atmosphere of epic apocalypse <em>perfectly</em> matched by a solid, memorable bunch of melodies and an intense performance. The middle break is filled with what you could call a "vocal equivalent" of the solo from [s]Brighton Rock[/s]: with the aid of an echo unit, first a solo Freddie, then the whole harmony section exchange lines with themselves in a way that's definitely novel and exciting. Meanwhile, fans of Brian's "guitar orchestra" will definitely want to hear their rendition of [s]God Save the Queen[/s]: as bombastic and over-the-top as it has to be. Brilliant. But Freddie, as should be expected, does not fall behind; not only that, but he brings here the most mindboggling and overplayed Queen song of all time: [s]Bohemian Rhapsody[/s], if you look at it coldly, is really a fancied-up (VERY fancied-up, let's be fair!) dramatic rock ballad... or would you dare say, <em>power ballad</em>? But then, there are power ballads like Aerosmith's [s]Dream On[/s] that are serious and sweeping, but a power ballad like [s]Bohemian Rhapsody[/s] is neither! It's a perfect song from beginning to end, and <em>everything</em> falls perfectly in place, right from the vocal harmonies at the beginning, from Freddie's solemn piano playing and meticulously crafted vocals, all the way to Brian's solos and the final, fading chord. Of course most of the talking you hear is concentrated on the "Opera" middle portion, which consists of <em>dozens</em> of overdubs creating an absurdly complex series of exchanges, crescendos, call-and-responses and hilarious calls of "Galileo Figaro" and the classic "<em>OH MAMMA MIA, MAMMA MIA!</em>", and as the icing on the cake, the whole thing culminates in a fast, hard rockin' climax. It is and unbelievable achievement (the overdubs were so many that the band was starting to wear down the original tape, and it took three weeks to finish just that one song), but it doesn't force you to swallow it as an "unbelievable achievement" because it is thoroughly hilarious and entertaining. But why focus on that one part when <em>the whole song</em> is brilliant? Say whatever you will: if you haven't heard this song yet, go check it out on YouTube <em>right away</em> and only continue reading this page after that. Hate it, love it, it is the ultimate Queen classic, never, ever to be topped.</p>

<p>But what about the other magnificent songs here, such as [s]Death on Two Legs[/s]? It was definitely a smart idea to leave [s]Bohemian Rhapsody[/s] for last, because it would be a shame to see it overshadow the most vicious, poisonous and angry Queen song <em>of all time</em>. It's even scarier to realise that it was not just a theatrical put on: the hateful insults and threats Freddie makes in [s]Death on Two Legs[/s] are directed to the band's ex-manager, Norman Sheffield. Brian May reportedly felt bad with it, but Freddie himself probably never regretted it. But the lyrics are just <em>one</em> aspect here: just listen to crazy structure of the song, constant start-and-stop, vocal exchanges and instrumental breaks. It's absolutely manic, and if you want to hear the more complex side of Freddie's songwriting, listen to <em>this</em> instead of [s]Bohemian Rhapsody[/s]. But the goodies don't end just in the manic, complex songs: the aforementioned [s]Seaside Rendezvous[/s] is one of my favourites here, featuring a horn section...  immitated by Freddie and Roger <em>with their mouths</em>. I love it. [s]Love of My Life[/s] is another classic, a sweet romantic ballad with Freddie on piano and Brian May playing harp. Of course, it's not your usual romantic ballad, as Freddie can't help peppering it with "orchestral" crescendos, and Brian adds a beautiful guitar solo. A highlight here, though, is Brian May's "folk ballad" [s]'39[/s], with gorgeous arrangements highlighting an otherwise simple, beautiful song led by acoustic guitar and an upright bass. The twisted thing, though, is that the lyrics are actually a thinly disguised tale about a <em>space mission</em>! If you replace the non-rhyming verse "sailed across the milky seas" with the rhyming verse "sailed across the <em>Milky Way</em>", it becomes quite clear that May is singing about the space explorator aging almost nothing in an interval of, apparently, 100 years and seeing Earth completely different from what it was. Incredible!</p>

<p>On the other hand, [s]Sweet Lady[/s] has always been a pretty disappointing rocker and, after all those years, I have only barely warmed up to it. It has the band making a really odd groove in the chorus, but otherwise it's unremarkable. Thankfully it's not offensive, and doesn't mar this otherwise amazing album. Do yourself a favour and don't miss this one, even if Queen is not quite your cup of tea. Nothing excuses not having this album around.</p>

A Day at the Races
1976
[s]The Millionaire Waltz[/s], [s]Somebody to Love[/s], [s]Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy[/s]
<p>The obvious question here being: is this album enough of a "sequel" to justify the continuing Marx brothers reference? To be absolutely frank, I don't know. In one hand, this album always sounded slightly less playful to me; or, to be more precise, most of Brian May's compositions here hardly evoke the lightheartedness of [s]Good Company[/s] and [s]'39[/s], and even Mercury has some stabs at less tongue-in-cheek material here. On the other hand, the overall style is basically the same, but the band sounds a lot more focused on precise things. Focus is good, of course, but not always and not for every band. For Queen, "focus" is more like a synonym to "limitation", and that's no good.</p>

<p>What is good, though, is that the album is <em>very</em> consistent in quality terms, and also presents a handful of classics to boot. These songs may not be anywhere near as groundbreaking and "experimental" (if you could say that) as those in the previous album, but is it fair to expect them to <em>constantly</em> innovate? They've already found the thing they do best, so as long as great songs keep coming out, one shouldn't complain about that. And good songs, here, there are aplenty. Particularly Freddie Mercury is on a real roll: all four songs he's wrote here are classics, and each one aiming at a different place. The most "serious" song he's done here is the piano ballad [s]You Take My Breath Away[/s], and trust me: if your idea of a Mercury piano ballad is [s]Love of My Life[/s], then you'll have <em>no idea</em> what this one sounds like. This song is solemn, dramatic and <em>sad</em>! If you thought Freddie was incapable of evoking sadness in his music, check <em>this</em> out! Also, don't be misled by the "piano ballad" part, as the song is full of vocal harmonies and guitar orchestrations, climaxes and dynamic changes and everything. It just doesn't have the fast middle portion of [s]Love of My Life[/s], but with a song like this, that would be plainly unnecessary.</p>

<p>On the flipside you have the smash hit [s]Somebody to Love[/s], which mixes the band's bombastic style with a <em>gospel</em> influence. The result must be heard to be believed; but you've probably heard it millions of times already, as this one is just a wee bit less famous than [s]Bohemian Rhapsody[/s], and in terms of melodic and harmonic content, it owes nothing to its "older brother". It just lacks the "opera" bit, but the vocal layering, the complexity of the song structure and all the ups and downs the song goes through makes this a well worthy successor. I am extremely fond, though, of the hidden gem on side A, [s]The Millionaire Waltz[/s], which is the closest thing you'll find here to the more flamboyant experiments of [s]A Night at the Opera[/s]: once again, Freddie's piano is at the very centre &mdash; man, you just HAVE to listen to the incredible interplay between Freddie's piano and John Deacon's bass! Actually, I have to say, this is far closer to [s]The March of the Black Queen[/s] than to anything on the previous two albums: all those different parts, slow sections slammed headfirst against heavy rocking passages, funny instrumental breaks... Yes, this is more [a]Queen II[/a] than anything else. It's great. And not so far behind is [s]Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy[/s], also multipart, dynamic and catchy beyond all imagination; after all, it's a short pop tune, isn't it? It's sort of a less silly and more radio-friendly [s]Seaside Rendezvous[/s] in terms of style, and everything about it is just beautiful.</p>

<p>As for Brian May, he does contribute some winners here, such as the opening heavy rocker [s]Tie Your Mother Down[/s], probably the raunchiest, most openly sexual song they ever recorded up to this point. Of course, it's all absolutely tongue-in-cheek and caricatured &mdash; could you ever <em>picture</em> Freddie Mercury belting out "It's gonna be tonight, my little school babe" with a straight face?? &mdash; but that didn't stop Brian from being embarrassed by some of these lyrics, particularly the "Take your little brother swimming with a brick" part. Either way, it's hilarious <em>and</em> it kicks ass, with a no-nonsense guitar riff over a fast bluesy rhythm, and Brian even does a little Led Zeppelin hommage by quoting Jimmy Page's solo from [s]What Is and What Should Never Be[/s]! At least I don't think it was a simple coincidence, and I don't think Brian would be dumb enough to <em>plagiarise</em> that bit thinking nobody would notice it, eh? Eh. But, as far as his songs here are concerned, [s]Tie Your Mother Down[/s] sticks out like a sore thumb among the more serious material. Just notice how the album kicks off with the main theme from [s]White Man[/s], which dissolves into a little "guitar orchestra" pattern that reappears at the very end of the album. Wow, a hint of "conceptuality" in a Queen record? You kidding me?? The most we've got from these guys was labelling the sides from [a]Queen II[/a] as the "White side" and the "Black side". But among the songs, the sunny poppy catchy [s]Long Away[/s] is a favourite of mine as well, with a melody that's as simple and modest as it can be and a lovely vocal performance by Brian himself. Of course he couldn't refrain from doing his guitar shenanigans halfway through, but one amazing fact is that he uses a 12-string electric guitar for the rhythm part; not something you hear everyday.</p>

<p>His other two songs, though, lay at the opposite side of the spectrum. [s]White Man[/s] is actually an amazing performance, and it's surprising to see the band pull of such a fierce, heavy sound. It just sounds way too heavyhanded to be as enjoyable as it could be... but maybe I'm being unfair. This song would easily be a total disgrace if handled by a more ambitious but less competent band, but Brian and the band deliver something quite strong. But a classic? No, sir, just not. As for [s]Teo Torriate[/s], I think I could live without it. The melody is okay, but it suddenly sounds like they are taking seriously <em>exactly</em> what they mercilessly deconstructed with [s]In the Lap of the Gods... Revisited[/s]: a sweeping, anthemic ballad coming from Queen just rubs me the wrong way. I understand that it was done as a homage to the Japanese fans of the band, and in that sense, it's sort of touching; but closing the album in such a syrupy note just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Surprisingly, Roger Taylor's song here <em>succeeds</em> in being a "serious ballad": [s]Drowse[/s] evokes <em>perfectly</em> the feeling of teenage boredom, with those sliding, whining guitars and the slow, dragging rhythm. So far, this song stays only behind [s]I'm in Love With My Car[/s]. And John Deacon contributes another winning, gorgeous pop gem with [s]You and I[/s], a song that's about as good as [s]You're My Best Friend[/s] but didn't become a hit. It may be more generic, but the melody is rich and the performance is as passionate as we could expect from Queen.</p>

<p>In one way, it's understandable that the band would try to break free from the "glam rock" and "tongue-in-cheek" area; a band like Queen was unlikely to wear masks for their entire career... maybe Freddie Mercury, but not the rest of the band. If this album has Brian May trying to gasp for air and say "hey, we can be serious too!", it shows just how much Mercury had a grasp of his business here. Of course, we can't talk of him "controlling" or being a "leader" of the band, and he was always horrified to be seen as that: it's just that his personality and style pretty much <em>define</em> the band at this point. The conflicts betwen the band members weren't few, though, but the best thing about these guys is that the conflicts <em>unified</em> them, and the contrasts only helped make the band more interesting. I confess: even if I may not be in love with [s]White Man[/s] and [s]Teo Torriate[/s], they add some <em>spice</em> to the album that is missing from [a]A Night at the Opera[/a], and I like this. So, yeah, I like the fact that some songs aren't very good. Doesn't make sense? Well, that's what Queen does to me. Go figure.</p>

[s]It's Late[/s], [s]Spread Your Wings[/s], [s]All Dead, All Dead[/s]
<p>So, what happened here? Once, the band was in a roll, delivering great songs in spades, with Brian making his guitar produce huge textures of sound, Freddie churning out amazingly complex yet catchy songs, and the band tying it all up together like no one else could. So, was it only a matter of the band getting some bad reviews and they decided to go more mainstream and "roosty". Is that really that? Well, in case you wonder, <em>yes</em>, it is possible that a band will willingly remove everything that is most interesting about them as a reaction to the bad rap. Well, it's an exaggeration to say that they <em>removed</em> all the interesting things, but they certainly reduced it to a minimum. On the other hand, though, the band's ambitions and grandiosity are at an all time high.</p>

<p>I explain: in case you're not living under a rock or something, you've heard [s]We Will Rock You[/s] and [s]We Are the Champions[/s] about a million times already, especially if you're older than 20. And you might hear everywhere about how amazing those songs are, and you may even think that they are amazing. The thing is, the <em>only</em> aspect in which those songs top their earlier classics is the <em>bombast</em>, because in every other aspect, they fail. Brian's [s]We Will Rock You[/s] may be strong and heavy and anthemic, and it may cause quite an effect in the right circumstances, but, come on! If this were 1976 and you just witnessed [s]Somebody to Love[/s] shot up to #1 in the charts, could you ever expect Queen to do something as crude and banal as [s]We Will Rock You[/s]? It's got nothing but the classic "BOOM-BOOM-CLAP!... BOOM-BOOM-CLAP!..." rhythm, the guys yelling some strong phrases on top, and Brian belting out a fine solo at the end. It's the most shallow and obvious thing Queen ever did since... since [s]Jesus[/s] or whatever!</p>

<p>But sad as it is, one has to realise that only Queen could have the guts and the chops to pull off a song like this and not make total asses out of themselves. Yes, they do succeed in that, but still, [s]We Will Rock You[/s] may be my least favourite Queen hit of all time. And as if it wasn't enough to <em>open</em> the album with a song like that, they follow it up with Freddie's anthem [s]We Are the Champions[/s], which may be melodically beautiful and everything, but still, it's pretty sad to see Freddie's sense of humour fly out of the window as he considers the life of a rock star "a challenge for all the human race". I have to praise the song for its musical content, though, as it is surprisingly sophisticated for the crowd pleasing power ballad that it is; it <em>is</em> enjoyable, after all, but, sheesh! This is the same band that opened one of the albums insulting and offending their previous manager! Now they are reduced to chanting "No time for losers 'cause we are the champions of the world"?</p>

<p>Okay, so they <em>are</em> the champions, we have to give them that... but the rest of the album barely hints at that. This album features some of the weakest and most inconsistent set of songs to ever feature in a Queen album. I can only believe the two main songwriters were on a bad phase, as Roger and John have <em>two</em> songs each! And Roger's songs, particularly, aren't even good enough to justify such a boost: [s]Fight from the Inside[/s] is only surprising for its funky rhythm and deliberately ugly guitar work, and only noteworthy for the fact that Roger plays almost everything in this track, because otherwise it's quite mediocre; and [s]Sheer Heart Attack[/s] is equally noisy and uglified, but this time is a weirdly timely fast, furious and no-nonsense rocker with some of the most deliberately obnoxious vocals (I'm talking about the "Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer heart attack!" chants in the chorus and the "I feel so inar-inar-inar-inar-inar-inar-inar-inar-ticulate!" afterwards) and jarring studio effects on any Queen record. It's timely because it coincided quite well with the punk movement, even though, as the title suggests, the song is older than that. Also, it's the first time that Freddie sings on a Roger Taylor song, in case you're wondering.</p>

<p>John Deacon stays away from the uglification of Queen and, instead, provides the latin-inspired pop tune [s]Who Needs You[/s], which features some smart Spanish guitar playing, and the beautiful power ballad [s]Spread Your Wings[/s]. Even though it's not as melodically rich as Freddie's overblown ballads, it's a pretty magnificent track in its own right, and the band delivers it with confidence. Some mighty fine surprises come from Brian May, actually. Aside from the aforementioned [s]We Will Rock You[/s], he brings the surprisingly beautiful, melancholy ballad [s]All Dead, All Dead[/s], which instead of going for the anthemic vibe of [s]Teo Torriate[/s], goes for an unusually understated, restrained mood, and the only bit of grandiosity is a terrific, gorgeous "guitar symphony" halfway through the song &mdash; after all, isn't that Brian May's most beloved trick of all? Of course it is. The multipart rocker [s]It's Late[/s], on the other hand, just simply rocks: excellent groove in the verses, nicely placed and well punctuated crescendi and vocal harmonies, and even some fast all-out-rockin' instrumental passages for good measure. It's wonderful to hear the band delivering such a driving and energetic song, combining the urge to "rock out" with the band's well known intelligence. Shame for the throw-away "white boy blues" of [s]Sleeping on the Sidewalk[/s], that comes and goes and does nothing. I only don't complain about it because it's a very spontaneous recording, with the whole basic track done in one take, and it's not really bad.</p>

<p>But, man, what about Freddie Mercury? Only <em>three</em> songs here are his? Well, it's true that the biggest hit here by far is his, but either he was deliberately opening space for the other members or he wasn't on a very stage. All I know is that [s]Get Down, Make Love[/s] is probably their most unusual and unexpected song up to this moment; it's pulsating and sparse rhythm, weird flourishes from all instruments and that bizarre middle break (that's not a synthesizer! It's Brian's guitar ran through several electronic effects) is, at the same time, obviously sexual but also just <em>freaky</em>! In one hand, it's a truly ballsy song, and it took guts to put out a thing like this &mdash; and oddly enough, it became part of their live set, but I guess it was just for them to freak out in the middle section &mdash; but, on the other hand, <em>yeech</em>. Thankfully it's not quite as disgusting as it sounds, because the band manages to keep it interesting in a musical level, at least; spending four minutes with a "horny" Freddie Mercury ain't exactly my cup of tea, but it's less icky than spending five minutes with a horny Robert Plant, if only Mercury pushes it so hard that it becomes silly.</p>

<p>At least the closing [s]My Melancholy Blues[/s], another pretty unconventional track, makes up for it: it's just Freddie in the piano and vocals, with Taylor and Deacon giving some hushed, gentle backing. It's beautifully drunk and pathetic, with some <em>nice</em> piano work, as it should be expected. Frankly, with an album like this, I should be thankful that it didn't turn out into a true disaster; but it got some severe beatings either way, and apparently the band decided to undo their "mainstreamification" and go back to what they did so well: <em>Roger Taylor screeching about teenage problems!</em> No, actually not. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay? For now, just consider that this rating would be one notch higher if it weren't for the two opening tracks... or, <em>at least</em>, if they weren't right at the beginning. Or if they weren't here at all: they released it as a single, so why not leave them there? Either way, there's enough good material here for the Queen fan to grab, but if you're just a casual one, stick with the compilations &mdash; I think they included [s]It's Late[/s] in one of them, and maybe you can get [s]Spread Your Wings[/s] too. Otherwise, don't grab this too early.</p>

[s]Dead on Time[/s], [s]Mustapha[/s], [s]Bicycle Race[/s], [s]Fat Bottomed Girls[/s]
<p>Ah, yes, this is the album that caused some loony RollingStone reviewer (forgot who he is) to freak out and go on a rant about how Queen was a fascist band. Why? No reason, I suppose; the same rant could be applied to every album up since [a]A Night at the Opera[/a]. Not that this album is the same as all those Queen albums, though! It isn't. Yes, it <em>is</em> closer to [a]A Night at the Opera[/a] than to anything else, since the band decided it was better to return to the mocking, facetious, puffed-up music of yore, instead of the "back to the roots" schtick of [a]News of the World[/a]. And what do I say? Hooray, I say! After all, this is the kind of Queen music that I like the most. While they don't reach the same heights of hyperactive creativity of [a]A Night at the Opera[/a], they still managed to <em>stuff</em> the album with brilliant music, and some other weird stuff as well. It isn't about the quality of each song individually, but more the fact that they come across as a wholly satisfying and entertaining package.</p>

<p>Also, the <em>sound</em> changed a bit. After producing their last two albums themselves, the band brought back Roy Thomas Baker to give them an interestingly sharp, crisp sound that sounds very new and fresh to the band. And... well, the music. The album opener [a]Mustapha[/a] (the source of my nickname, no less!) is one of the best here, easily. Freddie goes back to his Indian roots, but sets them on top of some heavy, energetic and catchy rock music like only those guys could play. You know, it's not the usual "rocking" kind of stuff: it's almost a nod to [s]The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke[/s], the start-and-stop, switch rhythms, call-and-response Freddie Mercury kind of stuff. It's short and great and heavy rockin' and all that, and it's not the only one of its kind, here! There's the classic [s]Bicycle Race[/s], a bit less entertaining to me, but that nevertheless squishes Freddie "epics" of old in barely three minutes. The result is an hyperactive multipart suite with sections that last about twenty seconds each &mdash; nonsensical call-and-response verses, a symphony of bike bells, a Brian May solo consisting almost solely of scales and Mercury singing about how he wants to ride his bicycle, he wants to ride his bike, he wants to ride his bicycle, he wants to ride it where he likes! How great is that? Well, in theory, it sounds pretty dumb, and it's not hard to find people who <em>hate</em> the song, and even fans who'd rather skip it when it comes, but I find it funny and entertaining.</p>

<p>But Freddie isn't any kind of "supreme god" in the album, since Brian also throws in some memorable songs in the stew; among them is [s]Dead on Time[/s], an amazing rocker &mdash that even more amazingle did NOT become a hit, but then again, it was never played live &mdash; and one of my favourite Brian May songs ever. It's very fast, very groovy, features amazingly tight band work, exquisite machinegun singing by Freddie and the kind of great guitar solos that Brian May's so good at; and the ending? I love the ending! Just listen to it yourself and you'll understand. The bigger hit was [s]Fat Bottomed Girls[/s], a far more simplistic raunchy rock 'n' roll song. You know, this is the kind of song that I could simply dismiss entirely if it were performed by some any band out there, but it's Queen's sense of mockery that makes this song so memorable. There's something about the way Freddie sings it that suggests he <em>doesn't</em> mean any of that, but his delivery is so good, and Brian's guitar so skilled and un-showoffy, that people can just take this as sincere stuff if they wished. Me, I just dig it. There are other great Brian compositions here, anyway, like the ballroom music send up [s]Dreamers' Ball[/s], with Brian once again employing his guitar to emulate a bigger set of instruments. And there's something delightfully funny about Freddie singing about dreaming with his loved one after being replaced by someone else. The other song is the nice, soothing, folksy ballad [s]Leaving Home Ain't Easy[/s], with yet another weird guitar effect that I suppose is meant to sound like a strings section. A cute folksy tune, and a nice addition.</p>

<p>Freddie also presents some material to the ballads department, with the bitter [s]Jealousy[/s], in which Brian once again modifies his guitar to give it a sitar-like sound. It's more piano dominated, sounding quite different from the usual tongue-in-cheekiness of [s]My Melancholy Blues[/s], for example; it almost sounds like Freddie is singing from his heart here! But to me, it's John who wins: [s]In Only Seven Days[/s] is as short, gorgeous and to-the-point as it could possibly be, and in this album, it's almost like a badly needed breather from the endless streak of eccentricity, that doesn't drop at all the level of sofistication. Of course, it's aided by Freddie's nice, steadily-under-the-top delivery and Brian's pad-like guitar effects. John also collaborates with the "crowd-pleasing" rocker [s]If You Can't Beat Them[/s], which is probably one of his most simplistic Queen songs. Guess it shows he was much better with the non-trivial pop melodies, but the band manages to maintain the energy level way above the average here. If you want non-trivial pop melodies, better turn to Freddie's own [s]Don't Stop Me Now[/s], a fast, jet-engine-propelled piece of piano pop, and one of Freddie's most genuinely downright <em>fun</em> songs. Reportedly, Brian hated the song for some reason, but nonetheless throws in a great, fully adequate guitar solo to make matters even better.</p>

<p>The remaining tracks are kind of strange. [s]Let Me Entertain You[/s], the "introduction" to the band, is certainly a very unusual brand of showtune crossed over with hard rock, though it isn't one of Freddie's catchiest songs; I always found it too melodically weak to be truly engaging as a showtune parody. As for Roger, he wasn't on the mood for delivering those fun songs about teenage problems, so he comes up with the weird, deranged groove of [s]More of That Jazz[/s], which supposedly brings the small bit of "conceptuality" for the album. Really, it's <em>also</em> not one of his catchiest songs; he repeats the "gimme no more of that jazz" line WAY too much, and his trademark screams start to grate eventually. However, [s]Fun It[/s] is quite a thrill, if only because it's so dumb. It's that kind of mechanised groove, with Freddie and Roger switching lines that are not particularly melodic, but the riff that drives it forward makes it worth a listen. Of course, that's <em>me</em>. And I say that no, not every song here is great. But there isn't any song here that I'd completely dismiss. In the end, it's the whole package that counts, and this is the band's most <em>complete</em> and satisfying album since [a]A Night At The Opera[/a]. Fans can't even hope to be without this album in their collection, and if you're growing interested in the band, you've got to check this out soon.</p>

[s]Dragon Attack[/s], [s]Another One Bits the Dust[/s], [s]Crazy Little Thing Called Love[/s]
<p>The end of the seventies apparently marked the biggest change to strike the band in their career so far. Fueled by their eccentric experiments in the <em>Flash Gordon</em> soundtrack and the success of the [s]Flash's Theme[/s] single, they start kicking in one direction here: slickness! Starting from the very album cover, for goodness' sakes. And just looking at Freddie's short hair and Brian's eyeshades is enough for one to deduce that <em>something</em> has happened. And yep, this is the beginning of an era in which Freddie would compose 50's rockabilly throwbacks on the shower and John would write smash hit singles that would influence <em>Michael Jackson</em>, of all people. Forget about dem Black Queen and White Queen and Killer Queen and all of that. This is the Synthesizer Queen, and afraid that they couldn't state that loud and clear enough, the album is kicked off by a burst of descending, swirling, cosmic noises as if a flying saucer was landing right on your backyard &mdash; in case you have a backyard, that is, otherwise, you should be well aware that you've got the whole wide world in your yard to explore, that you'll always find things you've never seen before and that's why everyday you're back for more. In case you didn't know that, you're probably a dunce. Me? I don't have a backyard, actually.</p>

<p>As for [s]Play the Game[/s] itself, it's probably the <em>last</em> kind of song you'd expect to hear after listening to such an introduction. It's a gentle-and-quiet-vs.-angry-and-loud ballad with the typical Freddie twists, like a darned catchy and untrivial little melody line in the verses, and a lighthearted, sing-along chorus with harmonies and all that. It's pure and absolute Mercury, and the flying saucer noises, even though they don't necessarily <em>enhance</em> the music with their presence, do absolutely no harm. A good sign, obviously. Through the album, they are considerably toned down, and surprisingly, the bits that most people think are synthesizers actually <em>aren't</em> synthesizers! A good exaple is John Deacon's first huge all-around-the-world smash hit single, [s]Another One Bites the Dust[/s]. The crazy sounds you hear there are mainly backwards piano chords and treated drums. And if they <em>were</em> synthesizers, they'd be a fine example of synths effectively <em>enhancing</em> a song, since they're there just to give more emphasis to the rhythm in strategic places. And what a rhythm! Funky drums, unforgettable bass riff, dark atmosphere and... well, just the rhythm section <em>makes</em> the song, but John wasted no efforts in coming up with simple, but memorable vocal lines and lyrics. Great song! Oddly enough, it should be reminded that this is <em>not</em> the first foray in funky rhythm-oriented music, and the first adventures were started by Roger Tayler, of all people, in gems such as [s]Fight from the Inside[/s] and [s]Fun It[/s]. What [s]Another One Bites the Dust[/s] has in its advantage, though, is an amazing bunch of hooks, both vocal, instrumental and lyrical. [s]Fun It[/s] may have had a more interesting riff, but Deacon's song here is a plain and simple masterpiece &mdash; and to impress Michael Jackson, you really have to have some fine brain cells working in the musical part of your brain.</p>

<p>John's other song is [s]Need Your Loving Tonight[/s], not as memorable and affecting but catchy and enjoyable, and it just kind of follows the footsteps of Freddie's hit single, the rockabilly send up [s]Crazy Little Thing Called Love[/s]. That one grew on me, as the band's image of motorbikin' leather jacket lovin' good ole rockers is so improbable, yet so convincing, that it couldn't help but totally win me over. It's yet another wonderful showcase of the band's versatility and eclecticism &mdash; and Freddie's catchy melody lines, of course. And as if that wasn't enough, it became a bit hit. That is Queen for you. The third Freddie composition, though, has always been a total bummer to me and still is: [s]Don't Try Suicide[/s] is the first Queen song that I <em>genuinely</em> can't stand, and I can say that I tried. Not that the wild dynamic shifts and funny bass riff wouldn't make a good Mercury single, but heck, he really overdid himself with coming up with grotesquely stupid lyrics. It sounds silly to complain about stupid lyrics at <em>this</em> point in the Queen page, but this is a case in which the lyrics are <em>not</em> compensated by anything catchy or clever, and instead are aggravated by some intensely dumb vocal tricks ("You got it!" and "Suuuuuuuuuui-CIDE!" gotta rank as some of the most cringe inducing moments in the band's oeuvre). It's a by-the-numbers song that bothers me with its intention of being funny. Brian May also overdosed a little on the power ballads a bit, here: [s]Save Me[/s] is a fine, romantic, and extremely beautiful ballad as is never crushed under the weight of the power chords; [s]Sail Away Sweet Sister[/s], on the other hand, goes in the sentimental path, with Brian providing the vocals himself (possibly for being highly personal), and I'm always a bit wary of people who deliver highly personal, sentimental lyrics over bombastic power ballads. It ain't [s]Don't Try Suicide[/s], but I hardly look forwards to it. May's other song, though, is a blast! [s]Dragon Attack[/s] boasts a super funky, strong rhythm section and a groovy, insistent riff. I also like it how each member of the band gets a solo spot, and aside from that, there's a lot of great interplay between them. In terms of excitement, it's basically a slow version of [s]Dead on Time[/s], and yeah, that says a lot.</p>

<p>Finally, Roger appears with a pair of delightful, catchy rock 'n' roll tunes, like only he could make. Certainly quite a difference from the bitter material on [a]Jazz[/a] and [a]News of the World[/a], eh? [s]Rock It[/s] starts deceivingly enough with a grand, soulful delivery by Freddie over a slow-as-hell guitar arpeggio, but Roger kicks him out with a fast tune, fun vocals and high pitched synth whistles. If anything, this song shows what a good entertainer he could be when he wanted to: the melody will hardly stick to your head, but the energy and sheer <em>fun</em> of the song just makes the whole thing work. [s]Coming Soon[/s], bizarrely enough, embodies New Wave with a cheery grin, breezy vocals, steady rhythm and all. Simple and nice, and I always get a kick out of listening to it. So, you can say this is the most democratic Queen record so far, with good effects. The fact that Freddie and Brian delivered the two weakest tracks could be thought of as a bad omen. But no, let's treat the following album not as a bad omen, but as a natural "evolution", okay?</p>

[s]Under Pressure[/s], [s]Life Is Real[/s], [s]Action This Day[/s]
<p>Well, there's a story that it was Michael Jackson who suggested the band to release Deacon's [s]Another One Bites the Dust[/s] as a single, and perhaps their friendship carried Queen towards new paths and horizons. Just to give you an idea, Michael himself said that this album was an influence on his album [a]Thriller[/a]. Can you imagine that? Being an influence on the best selling album of all time? Sheesh! This album isn't just Queen embracing synthesizers: this is Queen digging into the very core of 80's dance-pop, with all the synthetic grooves, airy and spacey production (that's where the title comes from, after all) and huge reverbs that make the drums go "psssh! pssssh! psssssh!", for good or for bad. Probably both. Or neither. Truthfully, this album didn't score too well neither with the dancing crowd nor with the Queen crowd. It kind of stuck there, in the middle. But honestly, I find it difficult to believe that Queen was taking this stuff seriously. At least May, Deacon and Taylor, because there are certain spots that convince that the album was used as a display of Mercury's excesses.</p>

<p>For starters, the album is kind of divided in two. There's little of that "dance pop" on the B side, but it is far more concentrated on side A. Each member wrote a song on that side, except for Freddie, who contributed two. And it's pretty blatant that it's Freddie who has the wildest approach to the style, fuelling his performances with sexually-driven grunts, hisses and words. Yes, and that's part of the reason why I utterly <em>detest</em> [s]Body Language[/s]. Apart from the fact that the synth bass line is only mildly catchy, the whole song is a puddle of blatant attempts at sounding horny. And the music itself is anything but entertaining: dull, overly repetitive and endlessly meandering. Really, I can't stand it, and I can name it as the only Queen song that I ultimately hate. It isn't even campy enough to be funny. Fortunately, [s]Staying Power[/s] is driven by a much cooler synth bass line (John would switch to regular guitar instead of his bass) and a funky, groovy synth rhythm punctured by actual brass stabs. Even though it <em>does</em> include the incredibly unfortunate lyric "blow, baby, blow", it does have a couple of cool instrumental breaks and sudden crescendos and stuff, making it a really dynamic, catchy piece. Honest to goodness, I really do like it.</p>

<p>The other members deviate a little from that form with their contributions. Brian's [s]Dancer[/s] is essentially a funk/rock fusion with a meaner, stronger rhythm with the usual "spices" thrown in for good measure. It isn't really very impressive, especially when compared to [s]Another One Bites the Dust[/s] and [s]Dragon Attack[/s]. At least, it's tolerable. John Deacon's contribution is radically removed from Brian's rock sound and goes straight into soul music.[s]Back Chat[/s] is indeed good, and even though Freddie wouldn't be the first person I'd ask to sing a soul song, he keeps relatively restrained and more focused on the melody, instead of his usual acrobatics &mdash; though they are still there. And it helps that the song isn't about sex. Same thing happens with Roger's [s]Action This Day[/s], who switches into "paranoia mode" with an appropriately tense rhythm and tense vocals and such, only turning into a "we gotta learn to love, to live" message in the chorus. I really like this song, for some reason. I think I like the way its tension contrasts with the rest of the album, and the sax solo at the end is so unlikely that you just gotta dig it.</p>

<p>Anyway, judging by the amount of "for some reason, I like this" you see, the rating for this album will be a bit unexplained. But then, what kind of explanation one can give about this album? The best I can do is say what I like and what I don't, because even to this day, the album still baffles me a tad. Fact is that there are some really good songs here. For example, Freddie's piano ballad [s]Life Is Real[/s], dedicated to John Lennon, is really beautiful and smart. It predicts his style of grandiose balladry revisited in [s]It's a Hard Life[/s] (the titles are a world apart from each other, huh?), and I like this one quite a lot. His collaboration with John, [s]Cool Cat[/s] is also great, flowing smoothly with Freddie singing it all in falsetto. Here's a good place to see some of Freddie's fabulous, unusual vocals you don't hear everywhere. Originally, this was going to feature David Bowie, and their aborted collaboration on that track spawned a great hit, the famous [s]Under Pressure[/s]. And what can I say? The song remains fantastic even to this day. The combined bass/piano riff is immortal, and so is the great interplay between Freddie's and Bowie's singing, and so are the lyrics: "mmm be bop!", "eee de dap!" and "mmm da da dap!" struck a chord with many people of that day. Okay, I'm sounding sarcastic here, and considering that so much of it is improvised, the result is fantastic. The switching between quieter parts and sudden, big crescendos and the climactic "this is our last dance" finale rightfully made this a classic. It's credited to all four members of Queen and David Bowie, and even though it was based on an earlier Roger Taylor song, it's largely Freddie's music and Bowie's lyrics.</p>

<p>I'm not a big fan of the others. Roger's [s]Calling All Girls[/s] spreads a message of love in a nice, pleasant but unremarkable way, with poppy acoustic guitars and sticky-sweet melodies. [s]Las Palabras de Amor[/s], a tribute to Queen's Latin American fans (of course, nobody in Latin America speaks Portuguese, *ahem*), is not bad at all, but it kind of pales in comparison to other Queen ballads. And Brian's rocker, [s]Put Out the Fire[/s], is an entertaining anti-weapon rant, but I used to like it more than I do now. These tracks don't really make the album worse with their presence, but they end up sounding like dull padding, even though it's hard to say which tracks here are "filler" and which aren't. Maybe there's no filler. Maybe the whole album was sloppily put together to cash in with a different crowd, or it was just a joke. I don't know. I <em>don't know</em>. All I know is that the album doesn't deserve a relatively high grade, but neither a low grade from me. Why? At least because of the balls it took to put out an album like this, with such a screaming cover to attact people walking three blocks away. You just gotta admire those balls.</p>

[s]Radio Ga Ga[/s], [s]It's a Hard Life[/s], [s]I Want to Break Free[/s]
<p>Upon returning, Queen decided to take a step back from [a]Hot Space[/a] by... dumping the synths? No. Dumping the airy production? Nope. So, what? Basically, they dumped the dance/funk music, and mostly applied Mack's "revamped" production to their usual brand of hard rock, but not quite. Even though there are but nine songs, the album's quite a mixed bowl. No two songs sound like, to everyone's benefit, and there's plenty of goody-goody music with a few small disappointments as well.</p>

<p>Say, May's raunchy [s]Tear It Up[/s] is pretty much a continuation of the sound of [s]Put Out the Fire[/s], and I'm not a big fan of it. The trashy-bashy hard rock sound doesn't do much service to a practically non-existant melody, and the line "I love you for your mind, baby, give me your body" may be the single worst attempt ever for someone to try to pass off as a "non-nasty guy". I'm sorry, I just don't like it. That's the only "disappointment" I'd name here, though. Of the other songs, I'm kind of bugged by the "socially aware" [s]Is This the World We Created?[/s] that closes the album. Look, I don't doubt that Freddie and Brian really worried about those things they say on the song, even if it had been just once in a life time. It just doesn't sound too fit to pop up in Queen's carreer at <em>this</em> point, does it? It just ends up sounding incredibly insincere and maybe even cynical. The music is pretty much designed to sound "poignant", even though Brian's acoustic guitar playing surely is top notch. It just doesn't feel quite alright.</p>

<p>But Brian doesn't come across as a total disappointment: [s]Hammer to Fall[/s] is a really cool, if generic and straightforward, rocker, improving a bit on the [s]Now I'm Here[/s] formula. The riff is quite classic, and the steady driving rhythm really keeps things going tight and nice. The other "rocker", so to speak, is his collaboration with Roger Taylor, [s]Machines[/s]. It might be quite fun to speculate whether Queen were really being <em>that</em> influenced by Kraftwerk when writing this song, but in fact, it doesn't sound that much like Kraftwerk, aside from Roger's use of the Vocoder. The song employs goofy "industrial" noises into the groovy rhythm and heavy guitar chords, and aside from that, it isn't such an unusual Queen song. I like it, though. But Roger's top moment here isn't on that song. His own [s]Radio Ga Ga[/s] became a quite big Queen hit, and in spite of all the DJ Bobo remixes and all, I really, <em>really</em> like the song. For one, the use of synthesizers and drum machines doesn't get at all in the way of the song; the use of electronics is intelligent, since the song was basically <em>written</em> for that. As such, the crazy hopping bass line and the chilly pad chords don't sound like cheesy additions, but like the very <em>soul</em> of the song. And it's not at all "cold" as you might imagine, if just because the melody and Freddie's delivery is so damn good. I hear complaints about the lyrics being stupid ("All we hear is Radio Ga Ga, Radio Goo Goo"), but as those words were inspired by Roger's little kid, what's there to complain about?</p>

<p>Talk about hits, this album brings one of the band's most unusual, memorable hits ever: John Deacon's [s]I Want to Break Free[/s]. It's a typical John pop song, in that it's <em>brilliantly</em> catchy and melodic, and the synthesizer arrangements <em>do</em> get in the way, but in a fun, quirky manner that's very faithful to Queen's style of ambiguous, sideways twists. The gay connotations the song achieved, I suppose, are mainly due to the hilarious video with all four members dressed in drag, making a parody of the TV show <em>Coronation Street</em>, and Freddie's bizarre ballet-influenced fantasies. The music itself doesn't have anything actually "gay", does it? Oh, well, if we're gonna think about it that carefully, Gloria Gaynor's [s]I Will Survive[/s] doesn't either. My problem is not with the song <em>being</em> gay or not (the day I become homophobic is the day I'm sent to an asylum), but with such reputation overshadowing the musical quality. It's a great song.<]p>

<p>Freddie's compositions are also quite diverse in style. The most unusual one here is [s]Keep Passing the Open Windows[/s], which I disliked upon first listens, for whatever bizarre reasons there might be. Maybe because it's a tad overlong. But in essence, it's a speedy, catchy little pop song, if a bit bloated. Notice that that's a different kind of bloated than of [s]It's a Hard Life[/s], you know. Like I said on the previous review, this builds on the ballad style of [s]Life Is Real[/s], but puffs it up way further with a full blown operatic intro, a fat and bombastic instrumental break and a powerful vocal delivery. It's a very pretty ballad, with good piano playing and all that. It's good especially because all that bloated arrangement isn't there to make it sound like it's more important than it is. And its follow up, [s]Man on the Prowl[/s], is a downright honest Elvis homage of sorts, with Freddie throwing a really, really entertaining performance. It's as simple and obvious as it could be, but incredibly fun, and featuring a really mean, awesome piano solo at the end by additional musician Fred Mandel.</p>

<p>My goal here, then, is to try to convince you that this album really satisfies me. Though an 11 isn't a <em>stunning</em> rating, it's surprising for a band that entered into the 80's for good, embracing all the synths and all that... though it wouldn't last. Thing is, perhaps this album deserved a lower rating, but at this point, I'm a bit hardpressed to start judging the merits and innovations of Queen's music in spite of its sheer entertainment value and good songs. At least, it's a nice, short, entertaining Queen album. And the band member portraits on the sleeve were taken in Rio de Janeiro. Hooray for <em>Rock in Rio</em>!</p>

A Kind of Magic
1986
[s]Friends Will Be Friends[/s], [s]A Kind of Magic[/s], [s]Who Wants to Live Forever[/s]
<p>You have to admit that, if you're making the <em>Highlander</em> film, there are few rock bands that would be as fitting to write songs for it than Queen. It is incorrect, however, to call this album a <em>soundtrack</em>: [a]Flash Gordon[/a] was a soundtrack, but this wasn't. But that's a minor detail; fact is, we should all know that epic sword battles and beheadings, immortality and "There can be only one", that's pretty close to the self-aware grandiosity of Queen. But "attitude" is one thing, and musical quality is another, and this album is remarkably short in good material. There are at least three tracks here that I utterly don't care about, and considering that there are only nine tracks here, that's a problem.</p>

<p>Also, the overall sound of the album is far shinier and happier than usual. It's still heavily based on synthesizers and keyboard, but the more unusual thing is the reliance on orchestras. Indeed, with the <em>Highlander</em> link, it's not surprising to hear a full-fledged orchestra playing in the record, but alongside with <em>Queen</em>, it's still odd. One of those instances did yield a classic: [s]Who Wants to Live Forever[/s] is a great song, and its sweeping and "epic" feel is nicely compensated by a strong melody and a powerful vocal performance by Freddie. Of course, it may not go down well to those fans of Queen's <em>tongue-in-cheek</em> bombast, because this bombast is actually quite... um, serious. But it <em>is</em> for a film, so it's at least justified. The other orchestral passage is in John Deacon's love ballad [s]One Year of Love[/s]. Now here's an unexpected one: if, when you hear of "love ballad" in a Queen page, you think of [s]You Take my Breath Away[/s] and [s]Love of My Life[/s], well, give THIS one a listen! It even has <em>a sax solo</em>. It sounds <em>exactly</em> like all syrupy, fairy-dust-sprinkled love ballads in the 80's, and it's only carried forth by Freddie's &mdash; actually very exaggerated &mdash; vocal effort. Understand me, I'm not some conservative fan who expects the band to do the very same thing over and over, and I have sufficiently demonstrated that here; but hearing that cheap Yamaha DX-7 electric piano sound plinging away on a song like this just hurts my soul.</p>

<p>However, it <em>is</em> melodically rich, unlike those aforementioned three songs I've mentioned. The first is the other Deacon and Mercury penned tune [s]Pain Is So Close to Pleasure[/s] is almost yucky in its Motown-ish, falsetto-laden attempt not to offend anyone. Gee, <em>what happened</em> to these guys? [s]Cool Cat[/s] was an okay tune, but for some reason, they're trying to repeat the schtick in a more upbeat, less "sexy" fashion. What's the point? I really don't get that one. Same thing goes for Taylor's utterly tuneless dance-pop [s]Don't Lose Your Head[/s]. Not even Freddie's singing can make this one stand out somehow; it just fiddles on and on in its corner and leaves no impression at all. Finally, Brian delivers the forced, exaggerated rocker [s]Gimme the Prize[/s]; the middle section with samples and sound effects does little to give this one any interest. Those songs do not really offend me, but I guess that, with an album as weak as that, I don't really mind them. If something like [s]Don't Lose Your Head[/s] replaced the more interesting [s]Machines[/s] on [a]The Works[/a], however, I'd probably be more upset. But here? Ehh.</p>

<p>The highlights, at least, raise this album way above the "sludge" level. Freddie and John compensate for their wretched little pop ditty with the gorgeous [s]Friends Will Be Friends[/s], a catchy, uplifting song that, in my opinion, deserves better than being labelled as a "power ballad". I enjoy it greatly, and it's by far my favourite here. Taylor comes up with the title track, which is a [s]delightfully[/s] catchy and upbeat pop single, with one of the purest and most enjoyable melodies he has ever penned for the band. It's a shame that he had to mar the record with that [s]Don't Lose Your Head[/s] duffer, because [s]A Kind of Magic[/s] is a darned fine tune. [s]One Vision[/s] is the band's collaborative effort at making a rocker, and it indeed rocks: it swings between straight-forward riff-rocking to groovy butt-shaking jams. It loses in the "catchy" department, but as a "band" effort, it works magnificently. Finally, Freddie's only solo composition is the "mini-epic" [s]Princes of the Universe[/s], an anthemic million-parts-per-minute that matches its tongue-in-cheek grandiosity with a great set of vocal hooks ("boooooorn to be kiiiiiiiings!"), nifty band interplay and vocal harmonies; in short, a "classic" Mercury composition that marries well his style with the band's eighties sound. You can find those songs in compilations, so don't go for this one unless you're the dedicated Queen fan who wants all their records, or who thinks that [s]One Year of Love[/s] or [s]Gimme the Prize[/s] is a REALLY important song to have. Me, I wouldn't feel terribly sorry if I had to live without it, if that says anything to you.

The Miracle
1989
[s]Breakthru[/s], [s]The Miracle[/s]
<p>Queen kicks back WITH A VENGEANCE. Not exactly. Okay, maybe. Who knows. With a slightly updated production and a handful of really good songs, [a]The Miracle[a] was a comeback of sorts for the band, after a small hiatus. Apparently the band really took some time to rethink their image, and they decided that they wanted to stick together as a unit much more than before: just look at the (slightly disturbing) album cover and, most revealing, the fact that <em>all</em> songs are credited to "Queen". But, of course, we all know who wrote each song, but that's not totally important. What IS important is that this album is a step above [a]A Kind of Magic[/a]. But how big a step?</p>

<p>For starters, there's a fair quantity of truly good songs here, and unlike the [a]A Kind of Magic[/a] songs, they pretty much evade completely the traps of "pomposity" or "goofiness" or whatever else. They're perfectly solid songs. Okay, I'll admit that the title track has the dippiest, cheesiest lyrics that Mr. Bad Guy could possibly assemble ("That time will come / One day you'll see / When we can aaaaaaaall beeeeee friends!"), but at least it <em>does</em> have some nifty and funny passages, like when he places the Hanging Gardens of Babylon right next to Jimi Hendrix as a Wonder of the world. But you see, the song is so <em>self-awarely cheesy</em>, that I can't help but love it. And the music is fun, uplifting, and well written in that good "mini operetta" tradition of Queen, with clever synth arrangements and a fast instrumental section that appears from out of nowhere and disappears beneath the sing-along ending. It's just <em>fun</em>, want it or not.</p>

<p>And if there's one thing this album offers in spades, it's <em>fun</em>. After all, without the <em>need</em> to go over-the-top at every corner, the album's just mainly one big, friendly goof-up, in which none of the songs is really <em>bad</em>. Yes, yes, I'll be a bastard again and complain about Brian May's slow, rockin' songs some more. [s]I Want It All[/s] is a classic of sorts, a slow, powerful anthem with a melody so simple it's almost braindead, and I'm not a fan of it. The <em>song</em> itself is not too bad, but all those guitar passages sound awfully contrived and tacked-on, for some reason. And you know there's something wrong when <em>I</em> am complaining about <em>Brian May's</em> guitar passages. It just doesn't fall together very well. [s]Scandal[/s], with its 80's guitar/synth riff and drum sound, is a tad more dramatic, dealing with his relationships with the press and all. It's a fine song, enjoyable enough, and in fact, I like it a bit more than [s]I Want It All[/s].</p>

<p>There are two other songs that I don't care much about, either, but the thing is that they are still enjoyable enough to fit the album without detracting from the really good stuff. John's Caribbean tinged [s]Rain Must Fall[/s] is his usual brand of radio-friendly pop, perhaps a bit <em>too</em> harmless, but at least it's not the adult contemporary syrup of [s]One Year of Love[/s], and [s]My Baby Does Me[/s] is a [a]Hot Space[/a] throwback a la [s]Cool Cat[/s], which is so dumb sounding that ends up being fun. As for the rest, it's all just fine and dandy. The two opening tracks make a small combo, with [s]Party[/s] setting up a dancey rhythm and some funny lines, and brings back all that great Queen energy with synchronised harmonies and rocking guitar parts. Its continuation, [s]Khashoggi's Ship[/s], goes towards the hard rocking path, and does a pretty good job at it! They're just two short tracks, but taken together, they're fine. And form a good opener for the album. Another really fun track is Roger's [s]The Invisible Man[/s], which is a sort of retarded kind of fun, but fun nonetheless. It's all about the catchy, infectious beat, and it features one of Brian's flashiest guitar solos, chromatic scales going up and down everywhere. It's always a good choice to show off your instrumental skills in a lighthearted, intentionally dumb pop tune; I mean, who can call you "pretentious" for doing that?</p>

<p>The other Roger song, [s]Breakthru[/s], is my favourite in the album. Starting as a completely different song altogether &mdash; an incomplete piano-led gospel chant penned by Mercury &mdash; it segues into a speedy, catchy and beautiful song that's among Queen's best 80's tracks, in my opinion. It's pretty much as flawless as a pop Queen song can be, with Freddie delivering a vocal performance that is a <em>spot on</em> balance between his strained high notes and his smooth mid-range. Brilliant tune. As for the fans of Mercury's witty songwriting, there's [s]Was It All Worth It[/s], which is easily his most, um, "complex" 80's song. The actual content, melody and such, is pretty simple, but the unexpected arrangement twists and exaggerated "orchestral" interludes work wonders with the song's funny, festive atmosphere. The "interludes", in fact, are quite impressively sequenced, as they are entirely synthesized. The final result is a really entertaining song, which does not try to "impress" with its over-the-top arrangements. It's just the good ole tongue-in-cheekiness. In fact, I advise you to run back through the review and count how many times I used words such as "dumb", "retarded" and suchlike. The band's classic 70's album could have been bombastic, over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek and pompous, but they were hardly "dumb". The band, here, decided to crank up to 11 the more uncompromised and loose side of their creativity, as if they were sending all their fanatical fans and harsh critics to Hell. In one way, it worked: if you're in the mood for some relaxing, upbeat music, [a]The Miracle[/a] really hits the hammer in the head. But on the other hand, dumbness does not equal <em>classic</em> in the Queen universe. You'll hardly hate this record, I say.</p>

<p>It seems the "dumbness" part didn't quite please the band too much, as it is pretty much dropped entirely here. In fact, the band seems to have undergone a transformation during these last 10 years or so which is quite unbelievable: the tongue-in-cheek pomposity is basically gone completely, and Queen is as close to a straightforward rock band as they would ever get. Don't take this as a complaint, though: Queen never depended on their "schtick" to be good, and the quality of their music always spoke louder. Besides, one of the reasons for this transformation may have been Mercury's struggle with AIDS, which was already diagnosed way back in 1987. And, spooky as it may be, it sound quite clear in this album that Mercury knew he wouldn't last long, and that <em>the band</em> knew they were on their final run. Not as "spooky" as it is poignant: we're talking about a band that didn't have a single line-up change for their entire 20-year-long career losing a musician as important and influential as Freddie Mercury.</p>

<p>Therefore, don't be misled by the apparently "playful" cover art. Already at the very start of the album, you're faced with the powerful title track, a slow, booming anthem of strength and will-to-power... until the song reaches the middle part, featuring Steve Howe (that's right, the Yes guitarist) on the Spanish guitar delivering some flamenco playing, and from there the song jumps from an orchestral mock-up to a hard rocking version of the flamenco riff and back to the main portion &mdash; all in classic Freddie Mercury fashion, of course. The whole song breathes that "epic" air, but if there is a band who is fully entitled to breathe "epic", that is Queen, right? The song is great and memorable as all hell.</p>

<p>The whole album has a feel of "hodgepodge" of stuff. It doesn't quite fit in a cohesive whole like in [a]A Night at the Opera[/a] or [a]Jazz[/a], but the result is nowhere near bad. Among the more epic stuff, you'll find hard rockers, poppier tunes, slow ballads and... some pretty weird stuff, like the Gospel anthem [s]All God's People[/s] originally written by Mercury and Mike Moran for the [a]Barcelona[/a] album with Mercury and Montserrat Caball&eacute;. These overblown Gospel-like arrangements and overly "twee" orchestral arrangements just don't sit tight with me. It's one of those cases of a song relying way too much on "power" and not in melody, unlike the title track. It <em>is</em> curious to hear the band go into that massive blues middle part, though. Also you have Freddie singing a song about one of his cats, [s]Delilah[/s]. It may be way too sickly sweet and silly for the faint of the heart. And beware! If the thought of middle aged men singing "Meow! Meow! MEEEOOOOWW!" in harmony makes you hide under your bed in fear, stay away from this one. But I like it, and I'm not ashamed to say it.</p>

<p>There's quite a bunch of stuff here that I'm really fond of, though. [s]I'm Going Slightly Mad[/s] is a sort of stab at "dark comedy", with Freddie delivering a minor key yet poppy melody in his lower register and the band members contributing all sorts of twisted instrument parts to give a wicked, disorienting feel to the track. On the more upbeat side, there's Brian's poppy and catchy-as-hell [s]I Can't Live With You[/s], which, to be fair, may be a lot more generic than what we've come to expect from the band, but they do a really good job with it. We all need a fair bit of happy and catchy music in our lives, and this one cuts it just fine. The harder rocking [s]Headlong[/s] is a little less interesting, but it's good and happy too. Roger's [s]Ride the Wild Wind[/s], however, is a personal favourite of mine: I like the super-fast driving rhythm and the way it contrasts with the slowish melody and soaring choruses. What's it with Roger Taylor and fast songs, anyway? I really like them!</p>

<p>If you're in for an oddity, check out the band doing heavy metal on [s]The Hitman[/s]. Well, I suppose that even Queen's hardest rocking songs could never qualify as "metal"... Perhaps [s]Stone Cold Crazy[/s], but instead of lightning fast, this one is slow and pounding. Black Sabbath immitation? Seems like it. It's not a particularly interesting track, though, and it sounds as the band is doing it just because they know it's their last opportunity. Another oddity is [s]Bijou[/s], a track largely based on synthesized chords and Brian May's guitar soloing. The band says they wanted to make song switching the guitar solo and the vocal parts, and the result is surprisingly beautiful. As for the other ballads, [s]Don't Try So Hard[/s] is way too melodramatic for my tastes, even though Freddie pulls off one of those vocal performances that are <em>really</em> worth hearing. However, [s]These Are the Days of Our Lives[/s] <em>is</em> a true oddity: the lyrics have a strongly nostalgic theme, which sound like they're about the actual band. Of course they might not be, and the song was reportedly written by Roger Taylor and <em>not</em> Freddie Mercury, but either way, it's poignant. It's a light, beautifully melodic ballad, a very welcome addition to the album.</p>

<p>Brian May's majestic [s]The Show Must Go On[/s] is, well, majestic, with a dramatic arrangement for synthesized strings and a powerful performance. Now <em>this</em> one definitely sounds like Queen knew this was their swan song... but then again, they did finish [a]The Miracle[/a] with the similarly swan-song-ish [s]Was It All Worth It?[/s], but that one was upbeat and jokey, and this one is neither: this one is heavy and pretty depressing, in fact: "Inside my heart is aching / My make up may be flaking / But my smile still stays on", eh? This is one of those stone cold classic Queen songs, and even though they have better offerings in the "power ballad" department, this is a great song and stays far away from the tastelessness that you may usually associate with "power ballad". It's beautiful, and, hey, if it was intended to be their true swan song, cut them some slack and let them make a huge and heavy statement, okay? It's the closing, not only of an album, but of a career, and in that respect, it does a good job. As for the album as a whole, an 11 is a nice, snug rating for an album that does entertain me, but doesn't do anything to deserve even the slightest status of a "classic". Consider this as a "high 11", though, and if you want a fair representation of late period Queen, this is a good recommendation.</p>

Made in Heaven
1995
[s]Heaven for Everyone[/s], [s]A Winter's Tale[/s], [s]Made in Heaven[/s]
<p>[a]Innuendo[/a] was released in early 1991, and Freddie Mercury passed away nine months later. He did, however, continue recording vocal tracks for the band &mdash; sort of demolishing my theory that [s]The Show Must Go On[/s] was an intentional swan songs, but, eh, things aren't always that easy to determine; I mean, I doubt that Freddie didn't know he wouldn't have the chance to put out another record with the band. And so, it happened that, more than three years later, this record came out: the remaining members of Queen teamed up with producer David Williams to take those vocal tracks and create finished tracks out of them. The result is a mixture of <em>a few</em> new tracks, as well as full band renditions of solo tracks by the band's members.</p>

<p>Let's see, out of the ten songs here (discounting one reprise and two "bonus" tracks, which will be discussed later), four are solo tracks, while the others include songs written many years before and even a composition constructed entirely on studio by Williams and finished later by the band. It's one <em>hell</em> of a mixed bag. For starters, the solo tracks are quite solid choices: the title track and [s]I Was Born to Love You[/s] by Mercury, Taylor's [s]Heaven for Everyone[/s] and May's [s]Too Much Love Will Kill You[/s]. Of those, the latter is easily my least favourite: instead of the piano plus orchestra arrangement of May's original version, we have an electrified power ballad that definitely pulls towards <em>the worst</em> aspects of power ballads. It's unfair to compare Freddie's vocals to Brian's, but the rest of the tracks really leaves a lot to be desired. Freddie's tracks are delivered well: [s]I Was Born to Love You[/s] suffers from some pretty annoying production tricks, but the band turns the pleasant, catchy synthpop-ish tune into an <em>extremely</em> convincing rocker, and [s]Made in Heaven[/s] is delivered magnificently, with the dramatic riff and the beautiful melody preserved intact. I just don't understand why they insist in filling the songs with weird synth noises and effects, as if the tracks need to be "enchanced" somehow. This gives to the album an artificial quality that was totally absent from their previous records.</p>

<p>The highlight here, though, is Taylor's gorgeous [s]Heaven for Everyone[/s]. All the subtleties and dynamics of the song are brought to life, and Freddie's vocal delivery is spot on. It's sort of odd to hear such a poignant track from Roger Taylor, especially considering that those dippy preachy lyrics in the bridge <em>do not</em> get in the way of the song. I have always loved this song. The other songs come from all sorts of varied sources; [s]Let Me Live[/s], for example, was an aborted collaboration with Rod Steward from the mid 80's, which is resurfaced here as a gospel-ish pop tune with all three vocalists providing lead vocals. It's actually a catchy tune, to be fair. John Deacon's [s]My Life Has Been Saved[/s] is a pretty good and pleasant ballad, given a light, non-power-ballad arrangement by the band that really works well. [s]Mother Love[/s] is a low key, dramatic ballad, unusually gloomy for the band. It has Brian May providing lead vocals to the last verse, because Freddie didn't have time to provide them. Yeech, morbid. I am a huge fan of [s]A Summer's Tale[/s], though, a gorgeous, appropriately wintery ballad, with an atmosphere that gently swings between light and evocative, and the melody is just beautiful. Another unusual thing for Freddie: write lyrics about a simple Winter scene, and exaggerating on epithets such as "What a truly magnificent view", "What an extraordinary place", "It's all so beautiul", "It's unbelievable" and so on. Either way, it's wonderful, and definitely deserves a listen.</p>

<p>But we also have really strange things, like the opening [s]It's a Beautiful Day[/s], which was actually built around some improvised piano playing and singing by Freddie. The band added all those synth parts and crescendos and whatnot, and to the unaware listener, it may not even sound like an improvised piece at all. It's pleasant, but insubstantial, and the reprise at the end turns into a hard rocking finale, with samples from previous Queen songs and snippets of Freddie's vocals taken from other songs. That's one thing I can't understand to: the whole album is littered with pieces of speech and singing borrowed from previous Queen tracks. Why? Yeah, I know that Mercury would often add those "aside" vocals on the songs, but the effect here is pretty distracting, especially since I recognise the original samples. It doesn't really add to the songs, and mostly sounds like the producer is trying to show off what he can do. A more glaring example of that is the freaky collage of sounds and snippets of songs that close [s]Mother Love[/s] &mdash; it's completely out of context and pointless. On some occasions, the studio trickery gives interesting results, though: [s]You Don't Fool Me[/s] was created in the studio by Williams out of a few vocal recordings, with the band arriving later on to turn it into a more-or-less complete song. It works, as it's nothing more than a 90's dance tune, and the band does a surprisingly great job with it, adding a funky bass line, a great guitar solo and other things. It pretty much sounds like an actually written song, given the repetitive and fragmented nature of dance tunes like this, anyway. The other occasion is the album's finale, which builds from the tail ending of the [s]It's a Beautiful Day[/s] reprise into a 22-minute-long <em>ambient</em> work-out, done almost entirely by Williams on a synthesizer and using bits of Freddie's voice and other things. For whatever reason, the last four seconds of the song are indexed on a separate 4 second track &mdash; some speculate that this was to make the shortest Queen track ever be succeeded by the longest Queen track ever, which is pretty silly but lightly amusing &mdash; and the ambient track starts with the D chord extended on and on through some Tangerine Dream-ish loops and other atmosphere. It works as a conclusion, but if you already have all the classic ambient and associated works ([a]Music for Airports[/a], [a]The Orb's Adventures in the Ultraworld[/a], [a]Selected Ambient Works Vol. 2[/a] and so on), you won't be surprised. But it's surprisingly good.</p>

<p>The album as a whole, well, I can't say it's surprisingly good, but let's face it: it could have been much worse. The only things that truly mar this album is that unnecessarily strong, haunting feel of "Freddie is dead but his spirit lives on" that the album tries to pass off, and the production that litters the album with noises, echo effects and whatnot. Other than that, there are some seriously good tracks here to be found. If you don't expect a masterpiece, you won't be terribly let down, but if you're a casual fan, don't bother: fish out the stand-out tracks (title track, [s]Heaven for Everyone[/s], arguably [s]A Summer's Tale[/s]) from whatever sources you have and don't look back. [a]Innuendo[/a] already works well as a swan song and a farewell for Freddie, if that's what you want, and is a better record overall. I like it more than [a]A Kind of Magic[/a], though. Sue me if you will.</p>
