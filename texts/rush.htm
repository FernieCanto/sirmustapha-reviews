<p>I guess one of people's favourite things is to hate Rush for absolutely no reason. You'll have to agree with me that Rush is a very easily hateable band, so you either like them or dismiss them without giving them a chance. Come on, I have never found any - <em>any</em> reason to consider Rush a <em>bad</em> band. Like virtually every band, they have bad songs and bad albums, but so what? I am completely unable to name a reason that makes them a bad <em>band</em>, and so, I can say that all the prejudice against Rush is completely <em>stupid</em>. If Geddy Lee has an unpleasant voice, so does Bob Dylan. If Peart writes stupid lyrics, so does Tony Banks.</p>

<p>The plain truth is that Rush is formed by three <em>unargeably amazing</em> players: any Rush hater out there has to agree on that one. And it isn't even because they're fantastic players, but because they <em>know</em> how to use their skills without being show-offy. Neil Peart, being an <em>absolute</em> virtuoso at the drums, worries a lot about keeping the rhythm and maintaining a consistent groove, and does it like it was a child's play - and then, he spices it all up with tasteful and sophisticated fills. Geddy Lee goes up and down on the bass guitar, and effortlessly provides some great bass riffs and lines once in a while. And Alex Lifeson treats the guitar like a rare diamond, providing guitar tones and chords that you could recognise in a snap: I remember listening the version of 'Oh Canada' used on the <em>South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut</em> movie, and thinking "Hey, that's Alex Lifeson!" with a single chord he played. And when he decided to solo, they were always restrained, and studied solos: not "mindless shredding" nor unemotional stuff a la Dave Gilmour (mind you, I'm just poking the Gilmour fans with a short stick here). Also, in my opinion, their discography has been quite consistent. They didn't really drop to a <em>real</em> low in their discography (though some people might want to point out <strong>Hold Your Fire</strong> as a "<em>real</em> low"), and since they began finding the way to their success, they have oscillated up and down only slightly, and so far, I can enjoy almost all their albums - some more, some less, but I can still enjoy them. You know I'm not the kind of guy who complains over little things, especially when there are bigger things to be fond of. And Rush seems to be one of those cases.</p>

  Best song: <em>Aw, come on, you KNOW which one is.</em>
</p>

</ol>

<p>John Rutsey was the drummer here, but he only played on this album. And if you read any review of the album before you came here, you'll know everything you should know about it. But if you're a moron, I'll tell you that they were not the Rush you may know. There were no intentions to dabble with Progressive rock or Fantasy worlds on here. They were just a plain hard rock band. And if you, someone who only heard about Rush a few times, imagine a plain hard rock album from them, you might expect said album to suck. They're <em>nerds</em>, you know. Nerds don't rock 'n' roll.</p>

<p>What <em>is</em> true about this album, though, is that it's <em>very</em> influenced by Led Zeppelin. Lessee, 'What You're Doing' has that kind of groove and low-pitched riff familiar to people who listened to <strong>Led Zeppelin II</strong>; 'Here Again' is <em>typical blues rock</em>, just like Led Zeppelin shown the world a few years before. And overall, the mood is very Zeppelinish, and all. So, you might accuse them of ripping-off Led Zeppelin - because, of course, Led Zeppelin shown the world the perfect example of NOT ripping-off a single note that any other musician even thought of composing. They NEVER stole anything, you know?... Aw, who am I kidding. I can't stand Led Zeppelin, and any band that helps demoralise and destroy the reputation of that band gets praise from me. But amazingly, Rush doesn't demoralise Led Zeppelin here. And even I, who <em>like</em> Rush, was quite amazed with the album.</p>

<p>Of course, I was only amazed by the album compared with what I was <em>expecting</em> it to be, 'cause it's not an "amazing" album. It <em>is</em> derivative and regular, but it's <em>good</em>! Plus, it's an injustice to call it just a "rip-off". You know, "rip-off" is a pretty serious accusation (at least to me). It means <em>plagiarism</em>, doesn't it? Let's see: taking the aforementioned Led Zeppelin, it's totally accurate to accuse them of plagiarism for 'Stairway To Heaven', since they took advantage of a very obscure and unknown piece written by someone else ('Taurus', by the band Spirit), claiming it was <em>their</em> idea, and transformed it into a megahit. You see, the opening few seconds have become insanely identifiable with 'Stairway To Heaven', but <em>who</em> has heard 'Taurus'? In short, Led Zeppelin built fame and fortune around someone else's idea. And it wasn't even "borrowed": they clearly stole the idea and labelled as their own. That, to me, is extremely unfair, not to mention that they did similar things many times prior to 'Stairway To Heaven', with those Blues songs. On the other hand, I can't accuse Rush of 'plagiarism', because <em>everyone</em> was listening to Led Zeppelin in 1974. So how can you say they were stealing the groove of 'Heartbreaker' and labelling as their own as 'What You're Doing'? They weren't. And listening to the album, it becomes clear that they were simply doing what they <em>liked</em>: they clearly enjoyed this kind of music, and were doing it because they <em>enjoyed</em> it.</p>

<p>Besides, it's very noticeable that they <em>were</em> trying to do something new, or at least original, all the time: what with the "deceptive" fast intro of 'Take A Friend', and the misleading "soft" first half of 'Before And After'? The guys <em>were</em> trying, and some of those tricks they play are quite fun. In fact, the album <em>is</em> a lot of fun. These songs are definitely nice. Firstly, I like Geddy Lee's singing here. I understand anyone who might be annoyed by his shrieking, but I think it fits well the music. He <em>does</em> try to immitate Robert Plant at times, but I enjoy his singing much more than Robert Plant's. Why? Robert always tried to sound <em>sexy</em>, and to be frank, I have <em>no interest whatsoever</em> in a blond male feeling sexy - not to mention that his singing was plain <em>obnoxious</em> many times. Geddy is just a plain rock 'n' roller, wanting to have fun and play good ole rock music. Just that. It comes across as more honest. And most importantly, these guys are <em>great</em> players. Geddy's bass guitar and Alex's electric are instantly recognisable right from the start, and extremely sharp; Alex even gets a couple of solo spots, and his soloing is <em>great</em> all the way through. John Rutsey was no Neil Peart, but his playing melded in extremely well with the guys' strings, and with the style of music overall.</p>

<p>And finally... these songs are good! There are a handful of solid riffs presented on here: 'Finding My Way' kicks off with a fast, rollicking riff by Alex, augmented by his unforgettable overdrive, and is a great, fast opener for the album. It's easy to see why, after the album closer, 'Working Man', it's the most remembered track here. 'Working Man'? You know that one, won't you? The one with the slow, heavy rhythm and the mammoth riff? That's a great track, and a great achievement for the band at such an early stage. It has it all: simple, yet clever lyrics; a memorable, awesomely entertaining instrumental break; and a cool, big finale. You don't need much more.</p>

<p>Everywhere else, the tracks are less original, but they're all quite good. 'In The Mood' may get a little grating, simple but bordering on <em>banal</em>, but you also have 'Take A Friend' - the lyrics (not only to the song, but to most of the album) may sound a little annoying (rhyming "friend" with "until the end", eh?), but Geddy never had high poetical aspirations, so you'll have to deal with it. The song is a solid groove, though, and even the shorter 'Need Some Love' has some fast sections to boost things up a notch. 'Here Again' is a seven-minute plodding Blues-rock track, not far at all from Led Zeppelin, but Alex gets a great solo spot. Also, he's already using that little pedal effect that he would use many times later (see "Soliloquy" from '2112'). So, they're already spicing the album with their own identity, eh?</p>

<p>Of course, you may have a completely different mind about the album. After all, this album is <em>prone</em> to be shunned and dismissed as derivative and trite by many. But I take it easy with it: even if I probably won't be putting it all the time, I have fun with it, and I consider it good. Frankly, I see no reason to give it anything lower than a 10. Just don't dismiss it before you listen to it - I almost commited that crime. Either way, good album. Get it, if only for guilty pleasure...</p>

<h2 id="night">Fly By Night (1975)</h2>
<p class="medium">
  Best song: <big>Anthem</big>
</p>
<div class="medium">
  Track list:
</div>
<ol class="trackList">
  <li><span class="good">Anthem ++</span></li>
  <li><span class="good">Best I Can ++</span></li>
  <li>Beneath, Between And Behind</li>
  <li>By-Tor And The Snow Dog <span class="good">+</span></li>
  <li><span class="good">Fly By Night ++</span></li>
  <li>Making Memories</li>
  <li>Rivendell</li>
  <li>In The End</li>
</ol>

<p>In case you didn't notice, this is the "big step forwards" for Rush. But frankly... I don't think it's a <em>big</em> step forwards. Yes, Neil Peart is is, the songs are going towards fantasy themes and all, but if you look closely, it sounds like they're <em>exactly</em> inbetween the hard rock area and the Big Pompous area of rock. They <em>know</em> which way to go, but they haven't gone all the way there. So, this is more of a transitional album than it is a <em>transition</em> per se.</p>

<p>I think I was pretty unfair to this album in the past. Listening to it closer, I can notice more good things than bad things. But still, Rush hasn't reached total balance yet. It would take some time, still. But this album <em>is</em> good, after all! The thing is, Rush aren't necessarily <em>improving</em> since their previous effort. They are <em>changing</em>, but they aren't improving in all areas. They're still feeling pressure from some sides - for example, this album has two "soft" pieces in the second side. While 'Making Memories' is a good, but not too memorable, acoustic ballad, 'Rivendell' is hardly impressive. If I'm not mistaken, the decision to write a ballad didn't come from the band. But still, the ballad shows more weaknesses than strengths. It's pretty much recycled material with 'beautiful' playing and Lord Of The Rings inspired lyrics. Oddly enough, I can't get myself to dislike the track. I just don't have strong feelings for it.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the album is brutally divided in "hard" side and "soft" part. 'Making Memories' and 'Rivendell' share space with the long, slow 'In The End'. It has loud, distorted guitars playing, but the mood is softer than anything else. It's also kind of repetitive and dull, but quite fine. The title track, however, remains as one of the band's finest pop tunes ever. The riff sticks to your brain right from the first second, the rhythm is fun, the melody is quite catchy... Overall, the band pulled it off very well. At least, it's hard to imagine that the band who did the album Rush did one year before could say "let's make a pop song!" and do <em>such</em> a fine pop song.</p>

<p>But anyway, I question this decision to split the album like that. Mostly because side A is hard and heavy <em>all the way through</em>. The tracks are all good, but while the first two are definitely entertaining, the third track gets on my nerves a little, and throws me head first into the "epic" 'By-Tor And The Snow Dog'. Not clever, I say. Still, 'Anthem' is a true Rush classic: good playing <em>everywhere</em>, great ideas spread everywhere, and so on. When the band really wanted to amaze you, they <em>did</em> it, and they did it like that. 'Best I Can' reminisces moments from the band's debut, but it's a <em>solid</em> song, argueably better than most tracks on that album. Fun riff, fun playing, fun singing, and Geddy's lyrics are as simple and striking as you can get.</p>

<p>'Beneath, Between And Behind', taken on its own, may be a good track. But in the middle of the side, it almost passes by as a blurch of sound. It's like the guitars will never stop screaming! But, if you take your time, you may notice the song is pretty well written. Anyway, it ends, and you're left into the band's first "epic". Ahh, yes: the history of the epic battle between prince By-Tor and the evil Snow Dog. Well, what can I say? The song's no utter masterpiece, but it's quite well executed. On surface, a solid hard rock song, that suddenly turns into a true battle between Alex's shrieking guitar and Geddy's growling bass. They pull of some cool riffs, as slower passage, and good wins evil once again. Fortunately, it doesn't feel like it was mercifully stretched over 8 minutes just because the number looked pretty. It earns every second of its length, and that's good to me.</p>

<p>Yep, Rush still had things to improve, but they <em>did</em> improve. And they were trying. Let's face it, the album could have been an utter failure. Mock the band as much as you want, they could be worse. They could be Uriah Heep. But they are Rush, and <strong>Fly By Night</strong> is a very good album. I humbly upgrade its old 7.5 rating, because I enjoy it better now. Shame for the bad track sequencing, though. What's bad is that replacing some side A tracks for some side B tracks makes things <em>worse</em>. Damn.</p>

<p>This is artistic growth for you. Or maybe not. Rush <em>did</em> aim for something rather big with this album. The only thing in question is whether they were competent enough to prove themselves worthy of becoming a "Progressive" band. The virtuosity, they sure had. But the songwriting? Well, I'll tell you the truth. I'm <em>not</em> disappointed with the record, and I <em>don't</em> dislike it. To put it simply, I don't see <em>what</em> is to be disliked about the record. If anything, it's decent. And in my personal opinion, it's a good record.</p>

<p>At least, it's better than <strong>Fly By Night</strong>. If, in one hand, <strong>Caress Of Steel</strong> doesn't bring the breathtaking and sharp production of the previous album and replaces it with a murky, rather dead sound, it certainly wipes out all the weak spots that were still hanging. The short songs in the album are all fine, and they aren't slammed together so violently like they were before. To kick things off, we have the arsekicking, fast and furious 'Bastille Day'. Yup, the song is definitely great, bringing riffs, usual guitar mastery, heavy instrumental passages, and this time, a pompous-sounding coda. At least, it <em>pretends</em> to be pompous, so it can match the thematics of the song. The lyrics deal nicely with the French Revolution, and the vocals actually sound more adequate on here. Given the speed and drive of the song, those shrieks and yells and that <em>"WAUGH!!"</em> at the end certainly give more energy to the whole package. The mood settles down in the following tracks. 'I Think I'm Going Bald' is obviously a joke - the blatantly generic style of the song and Peart's lyrics give it all away, but that doesn't make the song less funny or enjoyable, if you can stomach it. I certainly can. 'Likeside Park', on the other hand, is absolutely beautiful. The Led Zeppelinish style goes on, and this time, takes the shape of a "ballad" that definitely improves over 'Making Memories'.</p>

<p>And then, come the big songs. Say whatever you want, I have <em>absolutely nothing</em> against these two tracks. Sorry for sounding so defensive, but I definitely think it's unfair to condemn and criticise these songs so much. I won't disagree when people say that the voiceovers and the lyrics on 'The Necromancer' are totally stupid and ridiculous, but it's not like I give a <em>damn</em>. Obviously, the song is <em>far</em> more overblown than its predecessor, 'By-Tor And The Snow Dog', and the story grows up to be a full-fledged Tolkien fanfiction. The good thing is, the musical quality didn't drop. I <em>like</em> the piece, and if it begins to sound a bit boring, they suddenly pick it up with a great, fiery performance. The "scary" parts definitely don't sound really scary, and I think that problem could be fixed with a boost in the production (what's friggin' <em>wrong</em> with the production, anyway?). But I really dig the song, and that final part is definitely beautiful, anyway. It could have been better, but I definitely like it the way it is.</p>

<p>And 'The Fountain Of Lamneth'? Well, I've got definitely no complaints about it. But I will <em>never</em> be able to visualise it as a single piece. It sounds to me like those five or six songs were tied together in a concept as an afterthought, and I believe they were: they sound <em>completely</em> different and isolated from each other, like 6 songs, really. Alas, <em>good</em> songs. Those three middle songs, the ominous 'No One At The Bridge', the lovely 'Panacea' and the beautiful 'Bacchus Plateau', are all highlights, and 'Didacts And Narpets' will always be a funny little gimmick, no more. I'm not bothered by the drum solo and the shouts going all the way. It's an interesting idea, after all. The only pieces that somehow have to do with each other are the opener and the closer, that are, actually, one song and its reprise. They are supposed to give the song its conceptual structure, and also make it sound rather epic. And I do like those guitar themes, both the fast, electric one, and the slow, acoustic one that opens and finishes the track. Good stuff.</p>

<p>I might even say that this album is kinda underrated, even by Rush fans. Sure it's not one of their best, but it's certainly very representative of their early stage. It doesn't fall in the "transitional album" hole, which belongs better to <strong>Fly By Night</strong>, and it shouldn't be overlooked.</p>

<p><strong>Caress Of Steel</strong></p>

<p>SUMMARY: The most under-rated Rush album of all time.</p>

<p>I must admit that I have a soft spot for this album. This was the second that I bought (after "<strong>A Farewell To Kings</strong>"), and is still after all these years one of my Top 5 Rush albums of all time. Most people rather quickly dismiss this album, and heap praise on its sucessor "<strong>2112</strong>". To my mind, this album as a whole is far superior to "<strong>2112</strong>", even if it's title track is better than anything on "<strong>Caress Of Steel</strong>".</p>

<p>Unlike "<strong>2112</strong>", there isn't a bad track on this album. It kicks off with "Bastille Day", a hard rock track that grabs you by the balls, and doesn't let go. Heavy, with Geddy wailing like there's no tomorrow. The end is fantastic, with a reprise of the vocal melody on guitar that just sends shivers down your spine.</p>

<p>"I Think I'm Going Bald" is just great. A real funny track, that just becomes more relevant for me as I get older and balder. And though written as a joke, the thematic material resonates with a yearning for lost youth that links it with it's companion piece "Lakeside Park".</p>

<p>"Lakeside Park", with its quiet, beautiful melody, and its lyrics about the joy and freedom of childhood with memory retaining such wonderful moments, really touches me. And Neal's drumming is just superb in this track - basic, with just the right hint of syncopation in the use cymbal, hi-hat and bass drum in the moments between chorus and returning verses (and also through the final verses).</p>

<p>"The Necromancer" - dismissed by many as pretentious and childish (now there's a contradiction), it is a great piece of music. Sure, the lyrics may not appeal to many, but I liked them (and at least they weren't as cringeworthy as that other piece of fantasy writing, "Rivendell"). I also like the slowed down spoken vocals by Terry Brown <span class="edNote">[editor's note: Is it him, really? I thought it was Neil's slowed-down voice.]</span> - it suits the style and mood of the song. The first part is wonderfully moody, with a superb subtle guitar picking theme that just transports you into that tale. The second part is as heavy as Rush ever got, with the closing guitar/bass/drum in unison just fantastic. The third part, with its majestic E-B-A-B-E chord progession (and in the beginning, the spellbinding use of the open B and E strings) is just brilliant. And Alex pulls off just the right solo for the song.</p>

<p>Then comes the second overt Progressive Piece that Rush attempted (the first being By-Tor and the Snow Dog). Six separate pieces that really aren't a unified piece of music (aside from the reprise of the first theme during the final song), though themeatically the lyrics do provide a unified concept -  the journey of life. Whilst not as mature as "2112", I actually prefer this to "2112", and find it far easier and more enjoyable to listen to.</p>

<p>The introductory theme, and the rising opening song aren't the best part of the song, but they anen't that bad (great drumming during the parts that start with "And yet my eyes are drawn towards..."). Neal gets a drum solo, which is always great (and it's brief!!! unlike the drum solos in other songs - Kansas take note!). No-One At The Bridge is great, and Panacea is a gorgeous little piece. The highlight for me is Bacchus Plateau - great chords, great vocals, nice lyrics. A shame they cut off Alex, just as his Spanish inspired solo just gets going. Oh, well. The reprise is OK, but it does get a bit much by the end.</p>

<p>As a piece of 1970's Rush, this is indispensible - as an album, only bettered by "<strong>A Farewell To Kings</strong>".</p>

<p>If we are to separate Rush's discography by "eras", then early Rush ends here. Well, to be more precise, it ends in <strong>All The World's A Stage</strong>, the live album released after this one. But not only is <strong>2112</strong> the end of an era for Rush, but it's also a culmination. For one, they're pretty decided on what they're doing here. The album's divided in a twenty minute "epic" on side A, and six shorter, separated songs on side B. And not only that, but the songs are also more focused, and the "epic" (i.e. the title track) sounds really like the whole thing was planned from the start, not compiled as an "afterthought", with spare songs they had in their hands.</p>

<p>'2112' is pretty much what you're thinking: a "futuristic" epic tale about individualism in a future society, kind of like a cross-over of Ayn Rand's <em>Anthem</em> and George Orwell's <em>1984</em>, or whatever it is - though Neil claims he came up with the story on his own, and only later realised the similarity with Ayn Rand, and added the "dedicated to the genius of Ayn Rand" on the liner notes to avoid accusations of plagiarism. But like I said before, getting into Rush depends on your ability to get over the silly factor. And here, at least it's no fantasy tales and epic battles. It's about the "common guy" leading his peaceful, tranquil life, until he discovers an acoustic guitar, and finds his own personality - and proceeds to be oppressed by the "priests", killing himself afterwards. At least, Neil is pretty straightforward in his message, and doesn't go to huge lengths to include mythological figures, rambling philosophy or unnecessary plot twists, and such. Think about it: this could be <strong>Tommy</strong>. It isn't. Why people feel the need to flame the story, I have no idea.</p>

<p>And after all, Neil gives space for the <em>music</em> to develop - and this piece has the classic opening with the rocking, relentless 'Overture', which is a really great display of the guys' talents before they went into the more hardcore Prog territory. And 'The Temples Of Syrinx', which cames right after it, keeps up all the energy and puts it into a great rock 'n' roller with Geddy truly testing the ears of those who can't stand his shrieking. It's not just "shrieking", really: it's a big singing effort. Catchy, too!</p>

<p>After that, you'll have to make up your mind yourself. The "parts" of the composition are rather hit-or-miss, and none of them really make a huge statement as the two first parts and other songs like 'Bastille Day'. I guess my favourite is the bitter, pounding 'Soliloquy', with more great guitar work. 'Presentation' is an alright poppier song, with heavy choruses and a sudden speed-up and a guitar solo at the end. 'Discovery' is not much more than a plot point, showcasing a few moments of acoustic guitar beauty, and 'Oracle: The Dream' is a bit... disjointed to my tastes. The 'Grand Finale' finally puts things in order, speeding up the proceedings and bashing everything into the ground. Really good stuff, and the ending with the "attention all planets of the Solar Federation: we have assumed control" and the ultra instrument bashing is very well done, indeed.</p>

<p>It's pretty impressive, but it <em>does</em> work as an "epic" - to me, at least. The music holds up well, and I have no reasons to hate the lyrics, you know. I don't see reasons to do so. Anyway, what matter now are the songs. And by golly are they... not bad! Yeah! I'd be hardpressed to say one song here that I like as much as 'Bastille Day', but 'A Passage To Bangkok' comes close! It's fun, has a cool riff, has catchy vocals, and funny lyrical thematics. In a good mood, I can say this is the story of Neil coming up with inspiration for his epic stories. Yep, great song. 'Something For Nothing' is also good, not so much in the "hard rocking" vein, but with pretty good playing too.</p>

<p>The other songs are considerably more in the "pop" vein. I just never managed to like 'The Twilight Zone' too much, though it's not bad. 'Lessons', an Alex Lifeson composition, is quite fine. It seems he didn't try to come up with a poetic masterpiece, but it's a really fine 70's pop song. And finally, 'Tears' is Geddy Lee's ballad, and it's solid. I think I can see why someone would hate this song, but I like it. Not that it's "gorgeous" or anything, but it's honest and humble. Would you rather have a power ballad? For me, this is alright. As for the album, I think I'm confident enough to give this a blue rating. It's a bit of a weak 12, though, if only because I don't hear this one too much. But I like it.</p>

<p><strong>2112</strong></p>

<p>SUMMARY: A game of two halves*</p>

<p>Most fans consider "<strong>2112</strong>" to be the first mature album that Rush released. I think that is not the case. I think most people are seduced by the title track, and tend to forget the rest. Whilst the 2112 suite was certainly the most adventurous thing they had attempted, and they carry it off very well, the rest is just plain bad. There is no other way to describe it.</p>

<p>It's almost like Rush sensed they were at the threshold of a major change, and weren't sure where they wanted to go. Side 1 looked towards the future of compositional complexity and freedom. Side two looked back at the work of previous Rush albums. And it is this duality that ruins <strong>2112</strong>.</p>

<p>Side 1 is devoted to the title track, the 20 minute "2112" suite. And it is fantastic. The best thing Rush had done to this point. Ambitious, complex, and stirring, there is not a bad moment on it (which cannot be said of 
"Cygnus X-1 Book 2 - Hemispheres").</p>

<p>It begins with the Overture * a simple statement of the themes of the suite, but carried off with such power and passion. It just gets better and better as it goes in, with a majestic solo by Alex, a chord progression that would come to life live, and the ending with the 1812 overture on maximum guitar overdrive. And the end where Geddy sings "And the meek shall inherit the earth" over a quite acoustic passage is just spine tingling and haunting.</p>

<p>It then immediately launches into "The Temples Of Syrinx" * bold, authoritative, saying simply that the new Rush is here, and is going for the throat. A tale of a future world where computers rule a passionless, unquestioning society, it is awe-inspiring. It also ends with a splendid acoustic coda.</p>

<p>"Discovery" has some nice tuning up exercises by Alex, expressing the hero's discovery and exploration of the guitar. It then proceeds into a nice chord progression and vocal melody before launching into "Presentation". Hard, yet with just the right amount of emotion that Geddy imparts into the dual roles he is singing about. Another great solo ends the track.</p>

<p>Then comes my favourite part, "Oracle: The Dream". Nicely syncopated with a stop-start rhythm, with guitar/bass/drums in unison. Musically it is simple, but the syncopation makes it quite a difficult piece to play live (I know, I have tried), but very rewarding. Uplifting.</p>

<p>"Soliloquy" takes the tale to its bitter ending for the Hero of the tale, ending his life, and the music reflects the solitude and despair of the character. Very nice.  It then launches into "The Grand Finale" which is just boiling with sound and fury. It begins with a catchy chord progression, before leaping into a complex furious guitar and bass line (indicating things going out of control). It ends with the unbelievable voiceover * "Attention all planets*" * it is a breathtaking moment where the chaos of the music as it resolves around a distorted guitar note being held matches the drone of the voiceover. A curious feeling of dread and anticipation hit the listener as this is going on. It really is the best bit of the album, that 25-second ending.</p>

<p>Side 2 is a big letdown after such a superb start. It reminds me strongly of the "<strong>Fly By Night</strong>" album, but without the sheer joy of life that that album showed. Definitely a step backward.</p>

<p>"A Passage To Bangkok" starts things off quite strongly from a musical standpoint, with a great chord riff, and a seductive vocal melody for the chorus. The solo isn't much to write home about, with a boring chord progression made to imitate the acceleration of a train. The MAJOR problem I have is with the lyrics * they are very pedestrian, with the subject matter very uninspired * travelling along the orient express, and seeing the sites. Whoopee! <span class="edNote">[editor's note: Well, actually, the lyrics depict the people travelling, looking for <em>pot</em>, you know, "we only stop for the best." At least, that's what I've always heard]</span> In fact the entire second side of <strong>2112</strong> is afflicted with the worst set of lyrics that Neil has ever penned (excluding "Lessons" &amp; "Tears", which I'll get to in a minute). Actually, the fact that Neil only penned three of the five lyrics indicates to me he was going through a passage of writers block, perhaps. Nothing else could explain such poor lyrics.</p>

<p>Things only get worse with "Twilight Zone". This has got to be one of the worst songs ever recorded by Rush. The lyrics are just pathetic, and sung quite badly by Geddy (though in all honesty, how can anyone sing those lyrics and not sound forced * "look up to see a giant boy, just become his brand new toy"?). And whose bright idea was the whispering of the lyrics in the second chorus? The only saving grace to the song is the guitar arpeggio that forms the foundation of the chorus. And yet another uninspired solo.</p>

<p>"Lessons" is such a relief to come to after the previous songs, but even it has problems. Written by Alex Lifeson, it has a nice up-tempo feel to it, a very sunny guitar sound, with an uplifting chord progression, and a great little solo at the end. But the chorus * Geddy screaming, "You didn't listen again" - arragh! It just grates on the ears. What was he thinking?</p>

<p>Geddy Lee's "Tears" is next. A very plain acoustic song, but again it is just average * the verses are uninspired (both in song structure and vocal melody). The chorus does have a nice melody (sort-of), but nothing special in and of itself. And that's it * no middle eight, chord changes, nothing else. And it ends with a lame synth fadeout. Luckily Geddy's songs would get better after this.</p>

<p>Finally, some light at the end of the tunnel. "Something For Nothing" * a nice rocker, with better lyrics from Neil (again his obsession about freedom, and the need for individual action to preserve it). In fact, I think it sounds better than it does due to the, to be honest, filler material that precedes it. But it still gets you going, and I don't know if you want more from a straightforward rocker.</p>

<p>After this, Rush never looked back. They would embrace progressive hard rock with a passion, and deliver what many (including myself) believe to be their best album * "<strong>A Farewell To Kings</strong>".</p>

<p>This might be something like the "definitive test" for potential Rush fans or haters. You see, this album manages to pack the biggest amount of positive <em>and</em> negative aspects of Rush, at least in this era, in the most compact way possible. It's got no more than six tracks, two of them being longer than ten minutes. And while you don't have "epics" like '2112' or 'The Fountain Of Lamneth', you have a different sound from this band. No longer they are drawing inspiration from hard rock, and focus on progressive rock itself - a bit late, let's face it. Now, you get all sorts of tricky, unexpected rhythmic thrills from the drums / bass combo (after all, Geddy and Neil had <em>more</em> than sufficient skills to pull that kind of thing off), you get "epic", atmospheric keyboard effects, multilayered compositions and Alex's guitar less concentrated on RAWK 'N' ROLL heavy riffs. But his guitar is every bit as essential to the sound as it was before: he's just throwing more "complex" solos, and adding more to the rhythm of the song itself, if you understand me.</p>

<p>As far as the songs go, three of them are heavily focused on that kind of progressive sound. The other three, not so much. The first three tracks on side B, that is, tracks 3 to 5, while they aren't exactly <em>pop</em>, might be more welcome to those who are used to the songs on side B of <strong>2112</strong>. And honestly, I <em>do</em> like these tracks quite a lot. 'Cinderella Man', for example, in spite of its slight silliness, combines plenty of interesting little musical ideas efficiently, without sounding contrived. Alex also manages to show why his riffing is important, <em>and</em> that he still could put out a cool solo. 'Closer To The Heart', on the other hand, is one of Rush's purest, gentlest tunes so far. Yes, it's the one that would become the mandatory sing-along concert closer, but so what? In essence, it's a great song. The main guitar theme is pure niftiness. Only 'Madrigal' doesn't try to be much more than a simple empty-space-filling ballad. Not that other prog bands like Genesis and Yes didn't have such things, e.g. 'Harlequin' and 'A Venture', but... I guess it can stick around just for the sake of sticking around. I still don't care much about it.</p>

<p>Notice that those three songs alone are enough to raise some controversy about the band. They are enough to cause strong aversion in the weaker stomachs, but also perfectly likeable - even though I'm yet to meet a Rush fan that <em>loves</em> 'Madrigal', or at least admits loving it...! But since this is my website, what's important here is that <em>I like</em> these tracks. And no, I don't love 'Madrigal' either. In fact, I don't think I'll ever <em>want</em> to listen to 'Madrigal' other than to remember how it goes. But you see, it's as if those songs weren't controversial enough, and the band went forwards with <em>more</em> tricky stuff to stuff the album with. Okay, okay, I know that ten minutes of music ain't enough for an LP, so they put twenty-six minutes of PROG ROCK in it. You know, PROG. INTELLIGENT music. Music that causes a reaction "in your head instead of in your feet" - Robert Fripp. And, well... Okay, listen, I am <em>somewhat</em> sure that even Rush haters should open a small exception for 'Xanadu'. And why? Because it's well-written, well-performed, beautiful, only a <em>bit</em> silly and <em>balanced</em>! Yeah, those awful Rush excesses aren't very present here. All you've got is good music coming your way, switching smartly from the "atmospheric" keyboard intro, lightning-speed verses with tricky rhythmic breaks and slower, heavier sections with awesome guitar work. I don't see anything to dislike in this song, really! This is the ultimate combination of Rush's skills, not just because there are lots of skills thrown together, but they're combined intelligently.</p>

<p>If you're willing to check out the excesses, well, the other two tracks are there for that. The title track isn't all that bad, really. It just has a deceptively great "acoustic" solo leading into a not-so-catchy prog song with one of Alex's strangest, most dischordant guitar solos ever. Not that I have a big problem with dischordant guitar solos, but, you know, it isn't Robert Fripp we're talking about here. Still, I like the song because of the cool bandwork. You know, Rush just had a really cool sound by this time, and it's well showcased here. And 'Cygnus X-1', well, their cool sound is <em>also</em> showcased here, as well as... lots of other stuff: a "sci-fi" spoken word intro, a story about a space traveller being sucked into a black hole (which - gasp - has a SEQUEL!), all sorts of "ugly" twisted riffs and Geddy Lee bringing his vocal chords to their very limits. Just try imagining that, and try to guess if you'll like this. If your answer is "no", you're probably right. But come to think of it, I don't know if I'd answer "yes" to that question, and I don't mind the song at all. In fact, I really like some musical passages here, and the way it's combined is quite clever; not even close to 'Xanadu', but I don't find it all that bad. If some elements were removed, like the spoken word intro, I'd like this song way more, but I don't think I'd ever <em>love</em> it. It's cool (in its own, geeky way, but hey! I don't have anything against geeks), and not much more than that.</p>

<p>It will depend on your concept of "cool", I guess. But that's why this album is here for. Listening to it might be some kind of journey of self-discovery, and might reveal more about yourself than about that band. Ooh, philosophical, eh? Nah, not philosophical. It's just the truth: if you <em>hate</em> this album, even upon repeated listens, better give up Rush before it's too late. If you tolerate it, you can always try <strong>Moving Pictures</strong>. If you <em>love</em> it... What are you doing? Hurry up or else you'll be late for that Star Trek convention!</p>

<p>(not that I'm making fun of Star Trek conventions and the people who go to them - like I said, I have nothing against geeks, being one myself. I don't go to conventions, though, because... well, I don't have time for that.)</p>

<p>Even fewer songs. What are they thinking? Going <em>even more progressive</em> as time went by and Punk took over even more? Yep, it seems like it. But then again, there was a sequel for 'Cygnus X-1' waiting to be done. They couldn't abandon the project now, could they? And so, here it is: 'Cygnus X-1 Book II'! Even more excesses? Even more silliness? What would you expect from it?</p>

<p>Well, I say... I think it's a great track. Really! And I don't mean 'Cygnus X-1' "great": I mean it in the 'Xanadu' <em>great</em>. Why? Why, because there's only good music coming up in it! Awesome instrumentation as usual, great Rush riffs in every corner, beautiful and clever passages... everything! And none of those "excesses" that haunted the "first part" of the piece somewhat. Only good music. Maybe the point that some listeners might complain about are Neil Peart's lyrics for it. Suddenly, the story shifts into Greek mythology, narrating the epic tale of the war between the Mind (represented by Apollo) and the Heart (represented by Dyonisus). <em>And what does that have to do with space travelling and black holes?</em> Well, for some reason, the space traveller lands right in the middle of the story and puts an end to the war, thus becoming Cygnus, the "God of Balance". Touching. But then again, I don't have many reasons to care about the lyrics, much less to dislike the song because of them. The music is really brilliant, switching cleverly between all its different parts, combining its main themes, and even bringing themes from 'Cygnus X-1' into convenient places - that is, in the moments when the two stories meet. In fact, that moment is when the song slows down and enters a middle section that shows all the hidden skill in "atmosphere building" the band hadn't shown us yet, for whatever reason. All in all, this is, in my opinion, the ultimate Rush "epic", and luckily the last one. Not because they suck at it, but just after finding the "perfect" balance between all their elements, it's better to move on to something new than to start churning out copies of it. And that's what they did. Woo hoo!</p>

<p>In fact, the second side breaks into "shorter songs", just like before. But how can they be that much shorter if there's only three of them? Oh, yes! One of them is 'La Villa Strangiato', a nine minute epic that tells the story of... Nothing! It's <em>completely instrumental</em>! And completely devoid of stories to tell, the band breaks loose with completely mad, zany, cartoonesque and magnificently entertaining passages combined into one big, funny monster. Apparently, it's a musical representation of a dream Alex had once, and they couldn't have done it much better than this. The song delivers that feeling of "crazy dream" perfectly, without going overboard with weirdness, combining freak solos and strange harmonies with sheer entertainment and fun, complete with "cartoon" riffs and an abrupt ending. It's fantastic. Rush doesn't have a tradition of instrumentals, and judging by 'La Villa Strangiato', as well as latter classics like 'YYZ' and 'Where's My Thing', I actually wish they had.</p>

<p>But then, the two vocal songs here aren't <em>at all</em> bad. In fact, they keep up the level of quality without problems. 'Circumstances' is the shortest one, which kind of combines the tricky rhythms, complicated riffs and sudden changes between different parts into a compact, catchy pop tune! Well, okay, "catchy" is debatable. But I really like it. 'The Trees' avoids the pop format and sticks to a multi-part "mini epic", with lyrics talking about the revolution of the maples against the oaks for a fair distribution of sunlight. Eh? An ode for socialism? A lament over the devastation of forests ("So the trees are all kept equal / By hatched, axe and saw")? Well, according to what I've read, I'd say "neither of them". The lyrics are mainly facetious, and while they're clever and interesting, it's just great to know that Peart knew when and how to take himself lightly. As for the music, I'd dare say that it's a bit weaker than that of 'Circumstances', but it's still beautiful. Got to check out that acoustic intro! Man, Alex sure could do that kind of thing really well.</p>

<p>As for the album as a whole, I'd say that its short length is an asset: it keeps the album concise and increases the enjoyability per minute ratio. Yes, that was an intentionally stupid thing to say. But if you can understand me, that's fine. Fact is that this is one of my favourite Rush albums ever. It's so close to perfect, it's almost impossible. But it is possible, and is there. Live with it.</p>

<p>Just as quickly and suddenly as 1979 turned into 1980, Rush turned into a new band. Okay, not a <em>new band</em>... and maybe not <em>that</em> quickly and suddenly. But there were quite some significant changes here. In terms of structure of the music, the band seemed intent on leaving the "sidelong epics" behind; and to this person that writes you now, that was a good move. Not that their epics sucked, or anything, but tricks like those get old eventually, and Rush got off the bandwagon before it did, and <em>after</em> doing the solid 'Cygnus X-1' two-part suite thingy thangy. For the moment, they went back to the <strong>A Farewell To Kings</strong> way of doing albums, but investing more in the shorter songs, and leaving the longer songs in just for the sake of convenience.</p>

<p>But there are changes in sound, too. By the looks of things, they were quite carried away by the New Wave thing, and chose to go that way instead of going back to their "hard rock" past. The synthesizers are given even more importance here, but still <em>never</em> stealing the spotlight from the band itself. The "power trio" approach still lives and breathes and rocks and rolls like never before. Geddy Lee doesn't shriek and squeal like before, also: he tones down to <em>singing</em> almost at all times. And that's nice. Obviously, that doesn't stop some people from hating his voice, but so what? Do I care? If I did, I wouldn't like Rush, I think that's obvious. But yes, they did change their sound, and even though it was a rather subtle change, it makes a difference. Especially because it's very true to the album's title, that apparently refers to those crashing guitar chords and synthesizer tones and reverb into infinity... Heh heh. Okay, okay, maybe there's a philosophical meaning to it. Maybe Ayn Rand could explain it? Hah hah!</p>

<p>Oh, yes! Peart abandoned completely the fantasy/mythology thematics. No kidding! There's not even any sci-fi in here!Neil Peart is now a fully philosophical lyricwriter, tackling only in serious, relevant themes. Oh, no, no, I'm not really making fun of them. I never really minded his lyrics, and his "change" only means that he's more prone to writing some really good lyrics. There aren't too many of them here, but there's 'The Spirit Of Radio'. But the MUSIC? It's the MUSIC that really matters here! Isn't it? ISN'T IT? Whatever. I still think it is. And the music in this album is very, very good! In particular, side A is entirely fantastic. The first two songs are absolute Rush classics, and even the casual fan needs them. 'The Spirit Of Radio', in particular, is the best way possible for introducing Rush to the 80's... or introducing the 80's to Rush, or both. And it's easy to find a way to illustrate that "introduction": just check out the fast, rollicking riff that opens it. It's memorable as hell, as it rolls and stumbles all over the place with its speed. It's clearly not designed to "impress", you know. I don't think Rush is very fond of those kinds of things. And the introduction to the song comes crashing in, as if there's no tomorow, and the song takes off. It's groovy and  extremely catchy, and counts with a goofy, funny riff and even goofier reggae breaks. It works! There isn't anything "progressive" about it. It's just nifty, you know!</p>

<p>The next song, 'Free Will', does bring back a few of their "progressive" tricks, but merely applies them to yet another brilliant, catchy song. This one is boosted by the presence of an awesome instrumental break, with some of their very best bandwork. They had the best way of <em>combining</em> their virtuosity into one solid thing, instead of each going on his own direction. As for the songs in side B, I have nothing against them. In fact, I do like them. 'Different Strings' is a Geddy Lee written ballad that isn't as beautiful as a Rush ballad could possibly be, but that features a fragment of an awesome Alex solo. Yeah, it's a "fragment" because it gets furious just before the song ends. And 'Entr&egrave; Nous', while I find it very nice, is too innofensive to be compared to the songs on side A. There isn't anything outstanding about it, but I just love its positive and joyful melody and Alex's always dead-on guitar. He doesn't waste one single note, does he?</p>

<p>The remnants of their progressive style lie on the remaining two songs. 'Natural Science', clocking at 9 minutes, isn't one of my favourites. It <em>is</em> a great track, but it sounds a bit contrived at times. It might be with its structure of changing riffs and themes suddenly, or maybe with the lyrics. But there's a lot of great music to be found here, still. For instance: that second part, with the fast riff, is really good, even with the occasionally dorky vocal effects and stuff. And Alex throws in some more good solos to keep the habit. But since I already said side A is entirely fantastic, so you can guess what are my feelings for 'Jacob's Ladder'. I think it's a very interesting twist on "stormy" songs about storms, because instead of trying to create a "musical storm", the song transmits the imagery and feeling or <em>watching</em> a rainstorm from a distance, transforming the ugliness into beauty and vice versa. Or something. And it does so with the usual Rush instrumentation and riffs. It's mostly instrumental, see, with brief sung verses here and there. For the most part, it's just the musicians doing what they do best, only with a slow rhythms instead of the usual fast. And you also get to see some of that tasteful, beautiful keyboard work when the song quiets down for the "clouds dissipating" section. Very good stuff. Even if ever got to rank as an absolute Rush "classic", I consider it one of their finest achievements.</p>

<p>This entire album is worth of being consiered as one of Rush's finest achievements, as well. And it <em>is</em> a classic, and every beginner Rush fan should have it. But to be truthful, this album is more of a transitional album than a complete masterpiece. Listening to it, I can't help but have the feeling that there was something <em>else</em> to be shown here that wasn't shown. Fortunately, that little hole was filled when the next album came up. Perhaps it was just a question of stopping making such short albums... Not that I think length itself is such an obstacle, but in Rush's case, it looked like unused potential. Either way, a great transitional album is also a great album, so it gets a high rating; a deserved one.</p>

</p>
<div class="medium">

<p>No, I wasn't fooling you. This is really the place when there was no more "unused potential" for Rush. It was all or nothing - not that Rush never went "all or nothing" before, but their previous attempts tended more to "nothing" than to "all". Here, they definitely got it all, and aren't willing to waste one single opportunity. With this album, I not only can say that side A is entirely brilliant, but I can go even further and say all four songs are absolute Rush classics. Maybe not 'Red Barchetta', but I like it as much as the others. And it's not even a matter of side B being weak: it's up to par with Rush's work so far, but side A is so absolutely brilliant that it gets close to outshining the other side completely.</p>

<p>The songwriting department really took off, here; not like they came out of <em>nowhere</em> with such great music, suddenly. Their output was truly getting better, as they went, so this is more like a natural evoluton. It's like all the correct ingredients finally fell in the correct places. Not only that, but the production is every bit as tight as it could be. The band's instruments interact like they never did, and the synthesizers are used even more wisely than before, giving the perfect polish when needed. That bright, crisp, sharp sound runs through the entire album, without ever making it sterile. And the fact that it flees from most of the 80'sisms of <strong>Permanent Waves</strong> helps to make it one of the most timeless Rush albums ever. To complete the recipe, Neil's lyrics are pretty much on top form here. 'Vital Signs' might twirl the noses of many a listener, but the others? I find them quite interesting - yes, even the lyrics about a car on 'Red Barchetta', because it makes me think of the reasons Neil would write lyrics about a car: lack of inspiration? Self-parody? The possibilities are many!</p>

<p>Another fact that this album reveals (in restrospect) is that they were abandoning the "long song" format once and for all. It features the ten-minute-long 'The Camera Eye', and in my book, it stands somewhere between 'Xanadu' and 'Natural Science'. Some fans complain that the song is just one "song" played twice, and well, that's not too far from the truth. But 'Xanadu' was a bit like that, too! And it was great. And 'The Camera Eye' is stunningly beautiful. Similarly to 'Xanadu', it opens with a "quiet" intro, bulding on a simple sequence of synth chords, but it leads into a full-blown band performance, which evolves into the fast, rocking part of the song, built on Alex's riffs and guitar work. It should also be noted that, opposite to 'Xanadu', it doesn't strive to be a pompous "epic" track. It's even less "epic" than 'Natural Science', and it comes across as a quite simple, modest Rush song. The only bit of 'pomp' comes in 'Which Hunt', which features a slow rhythm, majestic synth work and all the ingredients to create the mood that the song title suggests; yes, it even has a intro with a deconstructed music-box-like melody, ominous synthesized bass string and "angry mob" sounds. You got the picture. But the song is very good, actually - very well written, and it's performed convincingly. Maybe I shouldn't be pointing out the "pomp" of the song so much, because I really do like it a lot. The most interesting thing is that it's regarded as part three of "Fear": the first two parts would come on their following two albums. The closing 'Vital Signs' is the least interesting in the album, really, sound a bit <em>too</em> derivative of other New Wave acts of its time (like, yes, The Police), with its guitar sound and ska overtones. There's nothing in it that makes it a <em>bad</em> song, though, and it only makes the album sound like it could have had a better ending. But that's no mean feat. Like I said, there's side A.</p>

<p>For starters, 'Tom Sawyer' is one of Rush's most overplayed songs, if not THE most. And it's easy to see why: in four minutes, it packs up practically everything that Rush were good at making, to this point. It has direct, simple, but memorable-as-hell riffs, a tricky but brilliant instrumental break, and on top of that all, Geddy's vocal melodies are always dead on. It's one of the definitive Rush songs, at least in the "pop" realm of theirs. Yet, I'm an even bigger fan of 'Limelight', a fabulous, beautiful song featuring some of the band's best songwriting skills. It's not even a "perfect" song like 'Tom Sawyer', as far as cleverness and dexterity are concerned, but I just love that song. I'm also terribly partial towards 'Red Barchetta', which, in fact, is a <em>fantastic</em> song for driving, roadtrips and whatever. But even if I wasn't particularly fond of that kind of stuff, I'd still be a fan of it. It's rather gentle for a Rush song, even with the unusual quiet-loud dynamics and the switching between its different "sections". It's just beautiful.</p>

<p>To those who might not be convinced still, there's the instrumental 'YYZ', which is every bit as brilliant as 'La Villa Strangiato' - and even more, in certain aspects. Clocking at just four minutes, it just doesn't stop throwing its clever tricks and riffs at you, like there was no tomorrow. It's particularly fun like, at many times, Geddy and Neil are exchanging little outbursts of solos, with Alex and his chugging guitar as the "moderator", and at others, Alex steals the spotlight with his solos. But even more remarkable is that groovy, frantic rhythm, reminiscent of 'The Spirit Of Radio', but far more hyperactive. To me, that song is a total marvel, but it's also a bit of a letdown, as it shows the <em>potential</em> that Rush had to make these incredible instrumentals. It makes me wonder whether they didn't make more of these because they preferred the songs with vocals, or they were just unable of coming up with more ideas for instrumentals. But either way, that doesn't diminish the excellent quality of the song, or of the whole album, for that matter. Rush was able to put out an album as good as this, and in the long run, that's what really matters.</p>

<p>Yep, Rush were certainly changing, evolving... well, er, that last word is actually debatable. I can see people who deny this album being an "evolution", and it's easy to see why. The band moves away from the "power trio" approach that worked so perfectly on <strong>Moving Pictures</strong>, and start giving more and more importance to the keyboards and synthesizers. To put it, the awesome interaction of guitars is pretty much completely gone. At least the guitars are still <em>there</em>, though, Alex didn't run out of solos and Geddy can still give his bass guitar a good whacking when necessary. And Neil is still Neil, both as a drummer and as a lyricist. Oh, yes, he's quite able of tackling futuristic and scientific themes without missing the mark and coming across as a complete dork; and hey, those themes kind of match the album's synthesized sound! I just don't know whether the lyrics or the sound came first. And you'll have to decide for yourself whether "excitement so thick you can cut it with a knife" is clever or dorky.</p>

<p>You see, but there are problems with that kind of sound. Geddy is neither Jean Michel Jarre, nor Vangelis, nor any other synth wizard out there, even though his playing is never subpar, and is actually more than competent. But he didn't have all that skill to make symphonies with the synthesizers, much less to compensate for the excellent playing skills of the band. This leaves a certain emptiness at times, like the songs have room to grow, but the keyboards leave them too bloated to do so. Add to this the worse-than-<strong>Moving-Pictures</strong> production, giving it a somewhat messy, muddy sound, and what you get is an album that would be a big letdown without excellent songs.</p>

<p>Well, as you might have deduced, the songs are the <em>big</em> saving grace of this album. There are eight of them, none longer than six minutes and a half (pretty much a rule for all of Rush's output from this point onwards), and all are remarkable somehow. Maybe not 'Chemistry', but the other seven? They're all worth listening. At least to me. And, yes, there are several "classics" here that are simply part of Rush, just like each of the three members. Hmm... really?Maybe. 'Subdivisions', for example. Yes, this album confirms the tendency that Rush had, from now on, of putting their biggest hits right at the beginning of their albums. And 'Subdivisions' sure is a candidate for best song in the album. I won't feel angry if anyone says it's his favourite. For some time, it kinda was mine, too. It's stupendous! For one, the keyboards come with full force here, smacking you right on the face, and throwing superb themes all over. And Alex's guitar... well, it's there. If you listen hard enough, you might hear it. But it does makes its presence felt, at least on a cool solo near the end of the song. And the song itself is beyond words: superbly written and performed as usual, given a certain "epic" feel that stays just at the right measure, all the time.</p>

<p>After that great introduction, a few other tracks also try to stab the "epic" feel. 'The Weapon' is part 2 of "Fear",and surprisingly (or non-surprisingly) it's not similar to 'Witch Hunt'. Gone is the "scary" mood. It's replaced by a quite ominous pulsating rhythm, bashed out by Neil on the kick drum, while Alex spreads a cool guitar line on top of it.It's tense, firm, and features a brilliant, lengthy instrumental break in the middle. Nobody is necessarily "soloing" in it, and the coolest thing is exactly how all instruments interact. It's pretty great, and I actually like the way Neil challenges the famous phrase "We have nothing to fear but fear itself" right at the beginning. Very nifty. 'Countdown' is the narration of a space shuttle launch. Hooray! How exciting. "Excitement so thick you can cut it with a knife" indeed! Oh, yes, well... I don't think shuttle launches are all that exciting as they used to be back in '82, and I don't think the song managed to make a "document" of that very successfully. What it did manage to do was to be a great song, that it did. This is the point in which the "pomp" endangers the actual music, but they successfully counter that with smart songwriting - even if the song isn't too impressive compared with the bigger highlights here.</p>

<p>Among the other songs, there are attempts at fitting the sound to the "simpler" pop structure of songs like 'Limelight'. The most obvious example is the hit 'New World Man', and while it's not an absolute highlight in the record,it's a perfectly nice and catchy song, and the best things about it, in my opinion, is how it reaffirms the power of Geddy's and Alex's combined guitar skills (couple of great riffs in there), and how it showcases their cleverness in writing melodies and lyrics to match them (or vice versa, I dunno). It only gets close to hitting on my nerves with its repetitive chorus, but they stop singing it before it becomes old. Still, I find 'The Analog Kid' better. It's speedier than usual, and for one, the synths seem to move into the background! Shame that there's still <em>something</em> about that production that makes it less crisp than the glory of <strong>Moving Pictures</strong>, but the production and the song itself are two different things. And the song is definitely a good one. Only 'Chemistry' doesn't seem to know which way to go, so it stays kind of in between: a not very inspired song, with more synthesizer filling than musical ideas per se. It's still entertaining, though. 'Digital Man' is better, with its pseudo-ska rhythm and more Police influences or what. Not that it's better <em>because</em> of that, obviously. I just like its rhythm, its melodies and the energy in it. Energy? Yeah, it sounds like it to me.</p>

<p>The one big surprise of the record is the <em>ballad</em> 'Losing It'. If you thought Rush ballads sound, as a rule, like 'Different Strings', you might have a shock listening to this. Neil writes lyrics about the fear of losing inspiration and not being able to recover it, and if that doesn't sound dark enough for you, the music will do so. The melody is subtle, but the instrumental work is gloriously beautiful (notice Alex bashing that one-chord riff), and they even include an electric violin to the song to raise it to a new category of "beautiful"! That's great. I love that song. And I definitely like most songs here. Shame that they don't quite fit as a whole, but Rush weren't experts in making that kind of stuff - except on <strong>Moving Pictures</strong>, in which side A sounds like all four songs were born together already, and side B doesn't fall too far behind. Either way, I find this one of their best records. And if anyone disagrees with me, swallow your own opinions and go sulk in your bedroom. No, WAIT! Don't do that!</p>

<p>Following the line of <strong>Signals</strong>: thick synthesizers, um... well, that's mainly it, really. There isn't much of a change between this and <strong>Signals</strong>, other than that the synthesizers are thicker and more proeminent, and the production improved overall. But see, there's a change in the songwriting, too... Maybe I can't give exact pointers on why this is, but I feel there's something of a process of... normalisation of the songs. They are becoming... No, not more generic, but more <em>normal</em>... less distinctive. There's still the recognisable Rush flavour, but it's mainly that: a flavour, instead of a style. The songs are less intelligently constructed than in <strong>Signals</strong> (not to mention <strong>Moving Pictures</strong>), the arrangements are less tricky, and... it's less exciting, you know, less interesting. On the other hand, it's dramatic as heck. If you thought the previous album was getting bleaker and darker, look no further than here: talks about war, holocaust, deceased people, humanoid androids... Whee. Very nice. Not that I have anything against that, really. In one hand, you could see it as positive, because they are talking about important, relevant things. Whatever. But the songs? Well, that's where the album fails to me. Not that it's their worst ever, but it's the point in which the stretch of great Rush albums stops.</p>

<p>See, most of the individual songs are quite good. But when taken together for a Rush album, they make a relatively disappointing package. You could say that the sum of the album's parts is better than the album itself, and I'll agree. See, there are very good, even great songs here: for example the bleak 'Red Sector A', written by Geddy Lee, which succeeds in being serious and intense without going over-dramatic or obvious. In terms of mood, it's very efficient, and the music itself is very well written. Also, Alex Lifeson's guitar is evidence here. Unlike many other tracks, the synths are there to back up his guitar, instead of the other way around. And if it's guitars you're searching, you should listen to the first part of "Fear", 'The Enemy Within'. There are few keyboards here, and it's mostly the "power trio" chug-chugging away to a tense, extra-groovy semi-ska rhythm. As a composition, it's awfully plain and maybe simplistic, for Rush's standards, but I like the performance, and there's energy enough to make repeated listenings worthwhile.</p>

<p>Everywhere else, as far as I can see, Geddy Lee is taken over by keyboards. Come to think of it, even his own bass guitar is losing importance - that's another reason why 'The Enemy Within' stands out. And only sometimes they manage to compensate that with smart songwriting. 'Distant Early Warning' is nifty, alternating slow, quiet verses with a fast, invigorating rhythm, and those shimmering keyboard chords and the chorus make it quite catchy. Also, I'm a big fan of 'Kid Gloves', in which Alex is given a bit of space to play really great guitar lines and chords, not to mention a really wicked, cool guitar solo. And the song itself, for one, is entirely well written and well arranged. Very, very pretty stuff. 'Afterimage' is the fastest one, close to a poignant "pop" song. Once again, it's quite unexciting as a composition, but there are a couple of beautiful twists in it. And 'The Body Electric', in spite of its lack of, um, relevance, is quite entertaining. Little more than that, but entertaining, and maybe kinda catchy, too.</p>

<p>If there's one thing I can't get, though, is that 'Red Lenses' thing. Judging by the overall way it sounds, I'd guess that it's a joke, combining weirdly "bluesy" verses with a strange, syncopated rhythm in between, with an obnoxious synth playing over it. And if it <em>is</em> a joke, I can't even say it's a very funny one. It has a cool instrumental break more or less halfway through it, though, giving it at least one nice thing to look out for. 'Between The Wheels' closes the album on a relatively low note. There's nothing in it that makes it a particularly bad song, but in comparion with what came before it, it's overblown and disappointing. And those two tracks make the album fall down as it ends, but it wasn't really <em>solid</em> before, so... it kind of stays all the same. It's weird. It's not a bad album, but if you're a "newcomer" to Rush, you'd only fetch this album for some isolated songs. But then again, who knows? I don't know your tastes, so maybe this album has a few tracks that you might love to death. I, myself, am a big fan of 'Kid Gloves', though I don't love it to death. And to me, this is an average Rush record, and I wouldn't spend big bucks on it.</p>

<p>The sound changes again. But more in terms of production than of songwriting. So far, it seems that their composing style is standing still - either stagnated, or they just found their own, comfortable place. But the sound changed big time, compared to the two previous albums. <strong>Grace Under Pressure</strong> wanted to close itself around you like a big wall of sound - <strong>Signals</strong> seemed to want the same thing, without much success. If you think of them like that, <strong>Power Windows</strong> is <strong>Grace Under Pressure</strong> inside out. The synthesizers and the guitar are airy, light, and crash like lightning before fading into a giant haze of 80's reverb. And you know? While those changes in production don't necessarily make their music better or worse, it does put it under different lights, different perspectives. That can be quite refreshing for someone who's wading through their discography.</p>

<p>As for the music itself, well, it seems to me that the songwriting this time around is tighter. Maybe they were just going hit-and-miss all this time, but if that's the case, <strong>Power Windows</strong> is the hit to <strong>Grace Under Pressure</strong>'s miss. Not that all songs here rule, but say, the weaker tunes still manage to hold the album together, and they don't come even close to taking the bright away from the highlights. They just float away, like harmless filler - though it is indeed alarming that there are songs on a Rush album that I can call "filler" (namely 'Grand Designs' and 'Middletown Dreams', for example). On the previous records, their songs were always noteworthy, either for being strong or for being weak. This album brings songs that are <em>not</em> noteworthy. Interpret that as you wish.</p>

<p>The annoying thing is that Geddy Lee becomes even <em>more</em> of a technophilian here. The positive side of that airy, open sound is that you won't run the risk of dying of sonic asphyxia, but on the <em>other</em> hand, it gave Geddy all the opportunities of filling the album with cheesy synth frills. They are <em>everywhere</em>! And I admit, they get very close to hitting on my nerves, especially because of the way they generate so much reverb. And, heck, Alex Lifeson isn't half as present as he once used to be. He still plays good solos, but hey, he always did that. The particularly bad thing is how Alex's super-clean, sparkly arpeggios and chords sound like synthesizers! Geez, there's just no justice in the Rush world, is there? At least Neil's drums are responsive and clear as they should be, and he either is aided by electronic drums (or at least electronically enhanced drums), or they drenched his playing in reverb as well. And yes, there's still quite a bit of mean bass guitar here, sometimes blasting really cool lines, like in 'Territories'.</p>

<p>As for the songs themselves, there isn't even one track here that I can say I dislike. Just those that I don't <em>remember</em>, but I certainly don't remember being repulsed by them. 'Middletown Dreams' has a really promising beginning, with the and working in some really cool, unexpected stop-and-go breaks and loud, syncopated crashes. But the melody? The chorus is kinda catcy, albeit a bit cheesy, but the verse melodies sound all improvised on the spot - though that's actually true of other songs here. 'Emotion Detector' has a fairly neat keyboard riff, but not much more than that. And as for 'Grand Designs', heck, even its keyboard riff isn't all that neat. Oh! And did I tell you that the average song length has increased? <em>Not even one</em> track here is shorter than five minutes, and the whole album's length is 44 minutes. Dire? Yeah, a bit.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the longer songs are all better. 'Territories' has a really groovy, entertaining rhythm, and they get around to some really good riffs and vocal melodies. And I also like 'Manhattan Project', even though its "epic" style borders on "corny" at times. So what do I like in it? Um... Good question, actually. It's really just another well-written Rush song, with enough good guitar work by Alex. Either way, I like 'The Big Money' better, which crashes in with loud synth and guitar chords, and sets in the foundation for a cool, entertaining Rush song, with a great performance and interesting rhythmic twists, switching time signatures like Rush can do so well sometimes. My favourite,though, is 'Marathon', which has an "epic" style that <em>doesn't</em> border on "corny", if only because it's so good. Well, maybe not "good" as much as "nifty", but the band's strength at this time is exactly in its niftiness. And nifty this song is, even more because of that instrumental break. You know, this song isn't any better than some of Rush's previous glories, but coming at this time, 'Marathon' is just a blessing, and the place in which they made their new sound truly work. Oh, yes, and the other groovy spot is 'Mystic Rhythms', which sounds like nothing else they ever did, I think. They get that dark, "mystic" sound just right, even though it melts into the usual Rush formula eventually, but it is quite good.</p>

<p>Okay, so there are those good songs. And I <em>did</em> say that the songwriting was "tighter" than in <strong>Grace Under Pressure</strong>, in the sense that the songs were more consistent. But the thing is, the critical lack of <em>great</em> things to talk about harms the album so much that not even its consistency compensates. Really, <em>what</em>here could make this an album worthy of a personal recommendation from me? 'Marathon'? Nah, I don't think so. I believe you can get the best songs here in <strong>A Show Of Hands</strong>, or on <strong>Retrospective</strong>, which end up making better, more concise packages for the casual fan. So what? Take this album as one of the classic "for fans (and reviewers) only". Which begs the question... Am I a fan? Not that I'd be ashamed of being a Rush fan. What? Do you think I care about my image and appearance? Geez, I thought you knew be better by this point.</p>

<p>Not that you should. We're not friends, or anything.</p>

<p>In the middle of all the controversy, here I am. And it's not because I like standing in the "middle", but in this album's case, like in many other albums' cases, I can't adhere to either side of the debate. See, there are those who claim <strong>Hold Your Fire</strong> is an abomination, an abysmal collection of stinky chunks of dentist muzak, while others just take it as another good (if not great) Rush album, with great attention to detail and production. You know, both sides have their valid points, and what else can I do other than consider them all? See, I can't throw any definitive veredicts towards the album's quality, but one thing I can say: even if you don't agree this is Rush's worst album ever (and I think it is), you gotta agree that this is the worst <em>introduction</em> to Rush ever, in all possible senses. I mean, imagine you had absolutely no idea of who Rush are, or once were. What might be your first impressions on them judging by this album? Eek, I can't even think of that.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, the sound. Well, at this point, I can only begin talking about a Rush album by its "sound", since their songwriting style hardly changes at all! And the basic thing is that it keeps building on the main formula of <strong>Power Windows</strong>. The thing is, the production improved a tad. Geddy, instead of stuffing every spot with generic synthesizers, seems more intent on exploring his keyboards' potential and using different sounds for every occasion. Or something. What I mean is, yes, purely on a level of production, this album is a step forward. And for one!Geddy didn't give up his bass guitar completely. Every once in a while, he comes up with a really good, tricky line, and even provides some of the songs their main drive. Cool, huh? If you can't have all of that guitar work by Alex, Geddy's bass might make some difference. His bass playing is always great, isn't it? Yeah... but the synth playing isn't. Just as its importance keeps increasing, so does its inadequacy. Just as there are the 'beautiful' "woooo"s and "aaaah"s, there are synthesized string sections, Heaven-like choirs, and all the stuff that comes with it. Just complete the picture yourself - you know how it goes.</p>

<p>And now, come the songs. All that I know for sure is that, never before on a Rush album, have I felt that the songwriting was so hit-and-miss as I have felt here. And I say that because there <em>are</em> a couple of misfires and near-misfires here, and also because some of the songs I like, I seem to like by accident. I can't tell exactly what's <em>good</em> in a song like 'Open Secrets', and others like 'Prime Mover' are damn close to irritating, but I can still enjoy them somewhat. But then, there's 'Tai Shan', and... Ergh. Man. Ouch. See, it's about China. A Rush song about China. Here, just think of how cool and interesting Eno's 'China, My China' sounds, <em>invert</em> those values and you have 'Tai Shan'. Melody-wise, there isn't anything really preposterous about it, but just hear those woodwinds! Remember that woodwind sound used in Peter Gabriel's 'Sledgehammer'? Yeah, that one. And Geddy overuses it to the point of obnoxiousness. It's clearly a synth patch, because it "yodels" always at the same spot. That, combined with the moronic way Peart deals with China, makes an essentially "passable" generic Rush song into a pain. By golly, these lyrics make me wish there was an episode of The Backyardigans in which they met Rush, just so that Tasha would listen to 'Tai Shan', and because of it, look at Neil Peart, put her hands on her hips, frown and say "Oh, for goodness' sakes!". You get what I'm talking about? I'm saying <em>die</em>, 'Tai Shan'. DIE.</p>

<p>The bizarre thing is that, not only the album itself is inconsistent, but some of the <em>songs</em> themselves are. 'Lock And Key' is the prime example, beginning with an extra-annoying "orchestral" intro and Geddy shrieking on top, and ends with Peart really crashing and splashing on his drumkit. The song itself? Eh... Try to remember the melodies after hearing it twice. I mean, <em>try</em> it! Most verse melodies on <strong>Power Windows</strong> sounded improvised on-the-spot, but here, it even sounds like there are no choruses whatsoever in some songs. There are hardly any hooks whatsoever. And the saddest thing is that, judging by the way these songs sound, it's like the band <em>didn't</em> want to write proper hooks, betting more on the "complexity" and structure of the songs. They just go, go, go and keep going!And they end up recycling verses and "choruses", and whatever they have coming their way.</p>

<p>Okay, really. Aside from 'Tai Shan', there isn't any song here I <em>dislike</em>. But the fillerish tracks border so much on the "annoying", that whether I'll enjoy the album or not will depend heavily on my mood, and the slightest variation can change everything. The songs I like? Well, there's 'Force Ten', which gets the album going on a <em>really</em> good note: a <em>fast</em> song which boasts some actual energy and drive - Geddy's bass again! - and catchy moments. Yeah, I mean hooks. The follow-up track, 'Time Stand Still', is a <em>pop</em> Rush song, as radio friendly as it can be. And not "radio friendly" just because it's easy-going, but also because it's good! Very good, even. For some reason, it includes a bit of vocals by Aimee Mann. It could have been even better if she participated more in the song (if only for the pleasure of having someone <em>other</em> than Geddy singing their songs, much more a female singer!), but it's fine as it is. 'Open Secrets' isn't really memorable, or anything, but at least I enjoy it all the way through.It reminds me of 'Middletown Dreams', a few times. 'Turn The Page' also presents a really good drive - Geddy again, with an extra-complicated bass line, and he actually played that <em>and</em> sung at the same time in live shows!! - although it has a couple of breaks with more of those annoying keyboards. Just when Geddy finds a really cool thing to play on the bass, he refuses to stick to it! Grr. It's a fairly good tune, though. And 'Mission', albeit having corny "gorgeous" chords and stuff, has a nifty instrumental break. I could do with more of that! Geez, songs like that show that they still <em>could</em> write cool, complicated things to play. Just why they didn't do those things more often baffles me.</p>

<p>And then, you have 'Second Nature'. A ballad. With echoey synth chords at the intro. With synth orchestras. With bombastic swells. Yeah, well, this is one song that, if you don't like it the smallest bit, then you'll necessarily <em>hate</em> it. Me? Again, depends on the mood. I don't mind it, though. The closer, 'High Water', at least has a bit of atmosphere. As for music? Well... I don't suppose it has much. But well, think about it: you <em>can</em> enjoy the album on an "atmospheric" level. It might work. But then again, you can enjoy it for its sound and production - which has nothing wrong about it, but... Eh. I have few reasons to listen to an album with few "really good" tracks and a load of songs that, on a good day, I just tolerate. But I don't join the chorus of haters of the album, no sir. The album isn't good enough to be that bad.</p>

<p>The band changes their sound <em>yet again</em>? Yep, you betcha. But... hey, hey, wait a minute! They didn't just change their sound, this time around! That change is very noticeable, but it's easily justified by the different producer of the album. But they changed completely their approach to writing music, as well! Yeah, no more of that meandering, pseudo-prog bombastic-quasi-pop of <strong>Hold Your Fire</strong> all over. This time around, Ged-a-Lifeson And His Pearts have relearned the concept of "hook", and lost all fear and shame of writing several friendly, nice, cutie-cutie tunes filled with hooks all over them. Sounds unlikely? It's understandable, since this is probably the first moment in Rush's history in which they abandoned <em>almost completely</em> the attempts at making intricate compositions and settled for making them catchy. The result? SUCCESS!!... well, for me, at least. This album is filled with really great songs, and I mean "great" not as in not-that-bad-for-Rush-standards, you know. I really like most of these songs, and there isn't even one that I'd get to call a "misstep". No annoying moments, no inadequate synthesizer warbling, in short, very little of what truly harmed the band's previous albums.</p>

<p>Yet, the change in production wasn't quite the best that they could get. It's true that there are less synthesizers, and that when they are there, they are used cleverly. But the sound of the band, in comparison to <strong>Moving Pictures</strong>, for example, has lost a lot of its strength. It's a thin, thin sound. And I can't even justify that thin sound with the fact that this is a primarily pop album. If they gave the guitars a big boost, for example, it would <em>still</em> be a catchy, entertaining and enjoyable album, and would be more efficient in delivering the yummy Rush goods of usual. The performances are top-of-the-tops, as they have always been. But what's the fun when they are restrained and nearly pushed way to the back? It's not even the case of pumping up the volume. In their best albums, of the early 80's and such, the band really made that "power trio" method work, with each musician standing as a counterpoint to the other two, and causing a small musical battle - not one member "versus" each other, but each member aiding the others' causes. On here, the three of them are just settled on their own place, tame and obedient, without making too much of a fuss because the teacher is a mean, scary guy and he hits his pupils.</p>

<p>But... oh, well, it <em>is</em> a pop album, and not a <em>rock</em> album. So, if you take it as a pop album by a certain band called "Rush" who may or may not have made great albums in the past, you're bound to enjoy it. I know I enjoy it. I used to listen to this album a lot in the past. I just don't listen to it that often anymore because I'm more busy with artistic, <em>highbrow</em> music like Vangelis, Sigur R&oacute;s and Men At Work. But whenever I'm not feeling highbrow, I know this album will be a really nifty listen. Those songs! It's like Geddy woke up one day, with a strange feeling deep inside his brain, and said to his bandmates "hey, dudes, do you remember how we used to write, you know, catchy, hooky tunes for our albums? Why don't we try some of <em>that</em> on our next record?" And Neil was all like "totally, dude!", and Alex didn't quite agree, because he wanted a more guitar-heavy album, but Geddy and Neil were against it. So, Alex gave in and they recorded <strong>Presto</strong>. And I'm glad they did, because it's one of my favourite Rush albums. Not in the sense of "this is one of the GREATEST albums Rush ever recorded", like <strong>Moving Pictures</strong>, but I enjoy these songs a lot. There isn't one track that I find weak. Some of them are filler-like, but none cause a bad impression. And since they <em>all</em> cause some kind of impression, no matter how small it will be, it means this album is very entertaining as a whole. Even the filleriest songs have some hook, or some intelligent thing. The songwriting in this album <em>is</em> intelligent and creative, and the more "uncompromised" style makes all that creativity come across more naturally, without the contrived "progressive" twists of <strong>Hold Your Fire</strong>. Oh, yes, and many songs don't have only catchy choruses, but catchy <em>verses</em>, too - aside from the usual guitar solos, keyboard riffs and such.</p>

<p>Side A is just brilliant. Of the five songs in it, I'd only discard 'War Paint', if necessary; it's a bit overblown and cheesy, compared to the others. All the others are great! 'Show Don't Tell' kicks in with a smart, tricky riff, which is the song's main theme. This particular song seems to ask for a <em>heavier</em> production at times, to make up for the "holes" in the sound - for example, in the chorus. But why am I complaining about the sound? This is one smart, very Rush-like song. But as far as the sound is concerned, 'Chain Lightning' definitely benefits from it, acquiring a sparkly, "electric" sound that makes justice to the title. And what a clever song that is! You'll understand what I mean with 'catchy verses' when you hear this one - not to mention the cool three-note guitar riff. One heck of a pop song, even though it's probably not suited to be your average "radio-friendly" Rush song, at least not as 'Time Stand Still'. More pop goodiness comes in the speedier 'Superconductor', featuring another catchy riff, clever switching between fast and slow sections, and a really good synth arrangement. You know, the way the band interacts with the synthesizer backing <em>almost</em> sounds like <strong>Moving Pictures</strong>. Make the sound "thicker" and you're pretty much there. There's also the title track (wow, it's been a long time since Rush had a title track, isn't it?). The lyrics are a bit more vague on their thematics, and the music is strangely "cute", compared to the others, but what a well-written song this is! Very beautiful, too. 'Red Tide' and 'Hand Over Fist' aren't at all bad, but I don't think they add a lot to the album as a whole. The former is based on a kinda annoying synth, and it's not really that catchy. 'Hand Over Fist' is nicer, but at that point, it's a bit <em>too</em> innofensive to cause a real impression.</p>

<p>An "anomaly" here, if we can call it that, is 'Scars', which brings up a quasi-disco rhythm, paired with a grim, menacing and <em>totally</em> groovy bass line. The vocal melodies are catchy enough, but I'd still like the song without them, only because of that scary, but boppy and danceable rhythm. We've got ballads, too! 'Anagram (For Mongo)' has a clever set of lyrics (even though they aren't <em>exactly</em> anagrams, since Neil unashamedly drops letters from the words, but hey, I can forgive that when I hear "Reasoning is partly Insane / Image just an eyeles Game"), and the music is kinda generic and unsurprising, but it's still nice to hear. Nothing compared to 'The Pass', though, in which Neil deals with teenage suicide over truly <em>gorgeous</em> music. This is easily one of my favourite Rush ballads ever - not as if I have a lot to choose from. Okay, it <em>is</em> one of my favourite songs of theirs. It's just beautiful, and it gets quite poignant on that last chorus, when Geddy raises his voice and belts out "Christ, <em>what have you done?</em>". It's a shame that he didn't have the chops to make that sound like it came from <em>inside</em>. You know how his voice <em>never, ever</em> changes ever since they made <strong>Signals</strong>, at least. But that's a minor flaw to me, particularly. A more dedicated singer could make that song much more emotional, but as far as Rush goes, I'more worried about the music. Another "ballad" ends the album, and 'Available Light' is also damn excellent, switching between different "sections" that just fall perfectly into each other. Very dynamic-sounding, you know, and it's got all the right elements. It's a perfect closer, managing to recover the attention partially lost with by two previous tracks.</p>

<p>I believe this is something of a "fan favourite", but then again, I don't know the biggest portion of the Rush community, so who knows? I wouldn't be surprised if this <em>were</em> a fan favourite. It's very good, very enjoyable, and a rather obscure item in the band's catalogue. Funny that they broke it big with the following album, which is nearly a follow-up of this one. <strong>Presto</strong> is still much better, though. I know I was already a fan of it way before I heard <strong>Roll The Bones</strong>, but I don't think that matters. Albums only "grow on me" when they are something completely new to me. And Rush won't be news to me for a long, long time, I think.</p>

<h2 id="bones">Roll The Bones (1990)</h2>
<p class="medium">
  Best song: <big>Where's My Thing?</big>
</p>
<div class="medium">
  Track list:
</div>
<ol class="trackList">
  <li><span class="good">Dreamline ++</span></li>

</ol>

<p>Yeah, well, I guess Rush were just unable to try each idea <em>once</em> only. I don't know whether they were satisfied with <strong>Presto</strong>, but if anything, this album can be thought of as two things: "hey, that album wasn't that good. We should try harder!" or "Hey, that album was SO good! We should make more like it!". And I guess it's missing the point a little saying <strong>Roll The Bones</strong> is more of the same, but they did keep going down the pop route. And it worked. It sold well, at least.</p>

<p>Thing is, though, the "novelty value" of <strong>Presto</strong> is pretty much gone, here. Besides, it doesn't sound  like they were tying to do easy, commercially-oriented music <em>their</em> way, but adapt to more generic patterns and sounds. I may be wrong, but it doesn't have the same spontaneity and cleverness as the previous album. The songs aren't much more creative, really, and the only spot in which their smart songwriting and performing skills stand in the spotlight is on the instrumental 'Where's My Thing?'. Now, you realise Rush's shortage for instrumentals, don't you? Even though it's eerie: it's like Rush didn't have any more ideas for songs, so they just threw this on. But it's a great song! It's amazing how, devoid of the shackles and obligations of easy-going vocal melodies and lyrics, their instruments take their steroids and shake everything into a <em>really</em> funky groove! It's not quite 'YYZ', you know: there are none of those manic riffs and solos. But the rhythm is extra cool, and they do a smart combination of riffs, bass lines and a really, really, really nifty tingly thing in the chorus, with those unexpected chord changes and a little keyboard melody. Not to mention Alex's guitar chugging diminished chords, or whatever they are, over Geddy's bass. THAT is a great composition.</p>

<p>As for the "songs", I can only count two that come close. Coincidentally, or maybe not, they are the two first tracks. 'Dreamline' brings some real energy into the album, in the shape of a speedy pop song, with a couple of different "sections" leading into each other... all of them very catchy! And it's memorable, too, partly because of that guitar line running through the quiet verses. 'Bravado' is a beautiful Rush "ballad", with more beautiful guitar, and a melody that reminds of some songs in <strong>Presto</strong>, in particular 'The Pass'. You know, it's kind of hard to tell why these songs are necessarily better than all the others; it just sounds like a bit more effort was put into them. There are other nice, catchy songs here, like 'The Big Wheel' and 'Face Up', but they're just not as memorable. They're the kind of song that you forget shortly after the album is over, but while they're on, they might or not be pretty pleasant. I like 'Heresy', though, with its "epic" sounding marcing drums and the guitar, and the title track is an entertaining, groovy song, that switches into an unexpected, twisted "rap" section halfway through. I find it pretty silly to take this rap as anything other than a silly joke. Not that I find it <em>funny</em> though... it's kind of a stupid gimmick. But the song itself is not bad. It has a kinda catchy chorus.</p>

<p>Those songs near the end do annoy me considerably, though. 'Ghost Of A Chance' has a strange, "hard rocking" guitar riff, and slower sections that seem to come out of nowhere. A nasty combination, in my opinion. And 'Neurotica' is pretty much a bunch of hot air, with a stupid, stupid chorus. What's up with <em>that</em>, really? To me, it's just "generica", "moronica", and whatever follows after that stupid "choir" of moaning Geddy Lees. 'You Bet Your Life' is a bit nicer, though, but with one annoying set of lyrics. Not <em>bad</em>, but annoying. You know, there's that thing about the lyrics in the album... Sometimes they sound so pessimistic, not in a "tragic" was as in <strong>Grace Under Pressure</strong>, but just bored. And it doesn't help that the music isn't very energetic, either. You know, it's kind of illogical that this album was such a success. It's pretty much a copy of <strong>Presto</strong>, with most of the entertaining stuff cut in half. Maybe that's what people want? Who knows!</p>

<p>This album was awaited with tension by Rush fans. And how could it have been otherwise? It had been 6 years since Rush put out an album, and with Peart's <em>tragic</em> loss of two people from his family, people didn't have much hope that he would come back. But the guys have proven them wrong, and kick back with this album. Neil <em>is</em> back, indeed. Of course, it's not to be expected that his drum playing would be in the same standards set by <strong>Permanent Waves</strong> and <strong>Moving Pictures</strong>, but anyone who spends 5 years without playing should lose <em>something</em>, ain't it? If <em>I</em> spent 5 years without playing the keyboards, I would forget where the C note is. But Neil <em>is</em> alive and kicking, and that is <em>great</em> news. It's also not unexpected that some of his lyrics would reflect his tragedies. But what's good, he doesn't <em>overflow</em> the lyrics with self-pitying crap. Besides, the lyrics talk about getting better. 'Ghost Rider', in particular, recreates Neil's travels through Africa on his motorcycle. And other songs are lightly tinged with emotional words. How often do you expect <em>that</em> from Neil Peart?</p>

<p>But enough with that. There is one thing: <em>ONE</em> thing that bugs the hell out of me, and that is the Dynamic Compression. If you don't know what it is, I'll explain it shortly: In a normal song, there are moments where the sound is louder, and moments where the sound is quieter. Say, when the drummer pounds on the bass kick or the snare, it is a <em>loud</em> moment, and the interaction between loud and quiet makes the Dynamics on sound. This gives the music that <em>punch</em> that we feel many times. Now, due to the limitations of the digital audio, if you want to increase the volume of audio, you <em>cannot</em> make any part of the wave go over the limit of 0db - that is, you'd be forcing your speakers to play louder than they're allowed to. In analog audio (vinyl, tape), there is no worry about that, but digital audio is different. If the wave tries to go <em>over</em> that barrier, it has to stand there, at the 0db limit: so there are cases where the wave becomes "flat" at the very limit, and this is called "clipping". So, if you want to increase volume, you <em>cannot</em> let it clip, otherwise there will be lots of unpleasant noise and distortion on the sound. So, what people do is <em>compress</em> the dynamics: the louder moments in music are <em>forced</em> down, and the <em>entire wave</em> becomes flat: a "square wave". So, the volume can be amplified without worry about clipping. Why do the guys do that? Becuse, when music plays on the radio, that particular song will come out <em>louder</em>, and people will pay more attention to it. It's like if you put your commercial on TV much louder than the others. It will attract more attention.</p>

<p>However, with dynamic compression, the music loses the interaction between loud and quiet, and loses its "punch". It's like you were listening to a blurch of white noise. And that's <em>exactly</em> what happens to <strong>Vapor Trails</strong>. The sound on here is <em>ridiculously</em> compressed. What's worse, what is the <em>point</em> in doing that? This is not radio-friendly pop music! There is no need to stuff the CD with loudness. If I want loud music, I'll raise the volume, thank you. And that dynamic compression severely harms the CD. Given the style of music, it makes the album sound even <em>more</em> samey that it already does.</p>

<p>Okay, hold on, hold on. I'm not criticising the CD. Fact is, Rush goes for a <em>harsher</em> sound on here: more rock'n'roll, more guitars, more power, more kickarseness. Thicker bass, pounding drums, lots of guitars... If anything, this is more comparable to <strong>2112</strong> than to <strong>Moving Pictures</strong>, as far as style is concerned, but far more layered and powerful. Better yet, the songwriting is as good as ever, on here. On first listen, you might be horrified by the samey sound, the compression and the piles and piles of guitars on top of each other. But, with time, you'll realise that the songs, individually, are good! Not good, but <em>great</em>! This might not be the <em>same</em> Rush we are used to, but this is a good version of Rush, making really good songs.</p>

<p>If the record sounds "samey", it's not because the songs are all the same, no siree! It's just the production and arrangements that are very similar, but I wouldn't be able to point two songs that sound <em>the same</em> on here. Each one has, at least, one distinction. And to tell you the truth, the quality of the album is <em>very</em> even. 'Ceiling Unlimited' is a taste of fast, guitar-driven; 'One Little Victory' has those <em>great</em>, powerful instrumental breaks; 'Ghost Rider' is darker and slower, and beautiful; 'Earthshine' has a great riff and a very eerie atmosphere and vocal lines; etc. I could go on for ages talking about individual songs, but that wouldn't be worth it, would it? Now, just take a look at the track listing above, check out the pluses and double-pluses and make your own conclusions.</p>

<p>It's not that the songs without pluses are <em>bad</em>, mind you. It's just that 'Peaceable Kingdom' is not very outstanding, and 'Secret Touch' is <em>really</em> overbearing at 6 minutes. 'Freeze' is also rather cumbersome, but at least, it is cleverly written. The contradicting bass and drums rhythms at the verses are cool. On the other hand, I really like the slow poppiness of 'Sweet Miracle' and the fast, mandolin-laden poppiness of 'How It Is'; the lightweightness and the chorus line of 'The Stars Look Down'... and I absolutely <em>love</em> 'Vapor Trail'. That guitar arpeggio, the chorus, the atmosphere... Man, what a song. It took me a while to go out and pick this one as my favourite, but it is.</p>

<p>Yeah, the album might be a little overlong (60+ minutes), but at least, it <em>is</em> a great album. Not the kind of album you would listen to thrice on a day: you would need new eardrums after so much loudness. I guarantee, if the album wasn't <em>BUTCHERED</em> by the evil dynamic compression, this would be as strong a 9.5 as it could possibly be. But then... that wash't Rush's fault, anyway. They are victims as much as we are. That's what record labels are for, eh? Destroying good music? Thank you, greedy bastards. May the world follow the example of <strong>Vapor Trails</strong> and <strong>Copy-Protectubular Bells 2003</strong>!</p>
