    "Give Me Back My Name!" The Adventures Of Ferny Canto
</h2>

<p>One thing that annoys me hugely is people that are too worried with looking 'normal', 'sane' and 'grown-up'. Of course that, as we grow up, we have to be responsible and balanced people to take care of ourselves, be a competent professional, and be trustworthy to the others. You wouldn't trust a total nutcase, would you? Well, <em>I</em> wouldn't. But the truth is that, no matter how much you try to hide it, you're mentally insane. We all are, to some extent. It's useless to try to be perfectly sane and healthy, because you aren't. You have your moments of insanity, your moments of utter childishness, and your moments of total silliness. It's part of us.</p>

<p>Not that that's any news, mind you! It probably even a clich&eacute;, already. But that's not what I was meaning to say in this Random Rambling&trade;, anyway. The point I'm trying to make is that, if you really want to be a "healthy" person, besides being responsible and balanced, you also have to take care of the child inside you. And I have learnt this through these little years of adolescence. I might be 19 years old as of August 28th, 2004, but I'm still a child. I <em>feel</em> like a child, inside, and that's what matters. And if you try to ignore and shun everything "childish" as you grow older, you'll be just ignoring your own nature. There's always a child inside of you, no matter how old you are. But that's not all: sometimes, you really have to <em>see</em> through the eyes of that child. You have to feel the world like that. And that's how some things will suddenly make sense: things that simply refuse to make sense to the "adult" that you are.</p>

<p>It's an amazing thought, really. Thinking like that, I have come to admire things that I never thought would appeal to me. And here is where I'm supposed to make the witty, masterful connection between those two paragraphs above and the <em>real</em> purpose of this Random Rambling&trade;, but you probable saw that one coming right from the very first sentence. You see, my mother takes care of my niece everyday, while my sister and brother-in-law are working. So, she leaves the TV on, showing those cartoon kids on a channel specifically aimed at children. And since I have to entertain my niece many times, I end up catching glimpses of those shows. And I'm not ashamed to admit that I have <em>watched</em> many of them. But they are, above everything, <em>kids shows</em>. Some of them are utterly, completely unappealing and right down dumb to me: like <em>Clifford</em>, that tells the tale of a red dog that grew to the size of an elephant simply because his owner cared about him. Others are just too sugary and seasoned with things designed to appeal to kids, like <em>Barney and the Backyard Gang</em> and some others. Others are plain annoying, suffering from annoying songs and bad Portuguese dubbing - like <em>Jay Jay, the Jet Plane</em>. But many of them are, surprisingly, <em>good</em>! I like <em>Rubbadubbas</em>, <em>Paz</em>, <em>Boo!</em> and <em>Save Ums</em> when I catch them on. But one of them <em>particularly</em> caught my attention one of these days.</p>

<p>My mother had noticed that one of the characters in that specific cartoon was called <em>Fernando</em>, out of all things. He was a little bull, and his parents are Spanish, so they called him Fernando. That show was called <em>Jakers! The Adventures Of Piggley Winks</em>, and I had caught occasional glimpses of it sometimes before. And when my mother told me about that, I was so amused I stopped to watch the show a little. The cartoon is all done in computer animation, and it centres on a family of farmers in Raloo Farm, in Ireland. The characters are all animals, and Piggley Winks is a young pig. His younger sister Molly, and his friends Dannan, the duck, and Ferny, the bull, are the main focus of the stories, which are told by an old Piggley Winks to his grandchildren, many years in the future. It's the usual "each episode has a message" thing, you see. That day I started watching, Piggley felt he was growing older and wanted to take responsibilities. So, his father made him a shepherd. But it turned out that he wasn't a good one, and left one of his sheep escape. After retrieving the missing sheep with the help of Ferny and Dannan, he admitted to his parents that he didn't do his job right - and he learnt that was the right thing to do, and never lost a single sheep again (this episode is called <em>Sheep About Town</em>, by the way, and it's from the second season).</p>

<p>And twenty-four hours later, I found myself watching the show <em>again</em>. And that's when I found out that <em>Jakers! The Adventures Of Piggley Winks</em> is, hands down, one of the most amazing TV shows I have ever seen. I absolutely despise the formula of American "sit-coms", and things like <em>Malcolm In The Middle</em> never have amused me the least. But you should know that I'm a huge fan of <em>The Simpsons</em>, and have been for a couple of years already. I also like <em>Seinfeld</em>, and even the controversial <em>South Park</em>. But <em>Jakers! The Adventures Of Piggley Winks</em> has touched a soft spot in my heart in a way no other TV show has <em>ever</em> done. Overall, it's a lightweight, entertaining, constructive and extremely intelligent show that I can watch with my one-year-and-a-half-old niece, my mother and my cousin without embarrassment.</p>

<p>You may think I'm cruel, but one major point that got me into the show without problems is the fact that the characters <em>DON'T SING</em>, as opposed to <em>Jay Jay, the Jet Plane</em> or <em>Barney and the Backyard Gang</em>... with just one amusing exception. According to a character guide I read on the Internet, Ferny <em>loves</em> music, and loves making his own songs, too! Say, we don't share only our names in common! But the difference is that Ferny knows when and when <em>not</em> to sing, and doesn't do so in show-off "Musical" fashions in perfect synchrony with his friends. I know that music is a powerful tool in captivating children, but I have always <em>hated</em> songs in kids shows, because they are, in general, unwitty and made obviously for children and children <em>only</em>.</p>

<p>But it's not only because of the lack of music, you know. It's the show itself that rules as a whole. When I watch an episode of <em>Jakers!</em>, I get the clear feeling it was written by <em>intelligent</em> writers, not by psychologists and people that studied how to educate children in the University. The focus of <em>Jakers!</em> is <em>storytelling</em>. The catch is that they tell constructive stories that carry messages across, and doing so with subtlety and cleverness, they drive the point home in a very comfortable way. I don't feel like the messages are being splattered and rubbed in my face. There are shows that <em>do</em> so, and 'teach' and 'preach' their messages in an extremely childish and unclever way. Maybe that's more effective with a younger audience, but as children grow up, they tend to get turned off by such stuff. That's definitely <em>not</em> the case with <em>Jakers!</em>.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm being unfair? Some shows <em>are</em> aimed towards a younger audience, and they tend to look more childish to me, and make me say those things. But there <em>are</em> shows for younger kids that I enjoy watching, like <em>Paz</em> and <em>Save Ums</em>. Even <em>Boo!</em> is funny and cute, in between the musical spots. But that's not what I was referring to, anyways. <em>Jakers!</em> is truly an amazing show because it tells stories in an intelligent way. Just as anyone can enjoy the stories and characters, teachers can bring the episodes to their classrooms and discuss them with their students, and parents can sit and watch it with their kids. It doesn't look <em>painfully</em> educational, but in my opinion, it works wonders to the minds of the little kids: not only for the stories, you know, but the twist of having old Piggley telling them to his grandchildren is a genius decision. It works in many levels, if you think about it: kids realise that their grandparents once were kids just like them, and that they also might have interesting stories to tell. <em>And</em> it shows a reality different from their own: life in the rural zone, in the 50's. Grandpa Piggley is one amazing character, and he works <em>FAR</em> better than a huge, red dog that can singlehandedly put out forest fires, in my opinion. That's one of the reasons why I enjoy watching <em>Piggley Winks</em> so much.</p>

<p>Yes, <em>one</em> of the reasons. Not only the stories themselves are amazing, but they are <em>presented</em> in an amazing way, too. One major advantage is the characters themselves. There isn't a massive plethora of characters in the show, but <em>all</em> of them are awesome. <em>All</em> of them. They aren't carton cut-outs <em>at all</em>: they have true, deep personalities; they live, they think and they feel; <em>and</em> they are captivating. You must know perfectly well when a story, be it a movie or a TV show or a book, makes you truly attached to the characters and makes you <em>care</em> about them, and when a story makes you completely ignore, or even hate the characters. And the characters of <em>Jakers!</em> are so well made that watching them for about 15 seconds will get you stuck to the TV screen. Piggley Winks himself is awesome and hilarious; Ferny is awesome and hilarious; Dannan is awesome and hilarious; and so the list goes. Even Hector, the mischievous rascal of the story is awesome and hilarious, because he's not presented as one of those one-dimensional characters that are present in <em>oh, so many</em> shows out there, and whose sole purpose is to be mischievous <em>at all times</em>. I could name Dannan as one of my favourite characters, but then I'd have to name Ferny, too, and Piggley, and Molly, and Piggley's parents, and Mr. Hornsby, so I will just say that I love <em>all</em> of them, and I simply have no favourites. Theorically, Piggley Winks <em>is</em> the central character of the series, though, and for a good reason. He would probably be able to carry the entire show on his back, but the writers aren't dumb, and make his friends <em>equally</em> important in the development of the stories. As a result, the entire cast captures your heart, and just watching them interact becomes a show apart. Forget about all that shallow and flat dialogue and interaction in other shows - we're talking about intricate stuff, here! You can almost believe those eight-year-old animals are real kids. If the screenwriters of those "hilarious" sit-coms had any sense of decency, they could learn a lot from <em>Jakers!</em>.</p>

<p>The show also counts with talented vocal actors, like Russi Taylor as Ferny and even Mel Brooks as Wiley, the talking sheep. Since the show takes place entirely on Ireland, the characters have hilarious Irish accents that, at least to me, are hilarious on their own already. But the voice acting makes the characters even more adorable to watch. Voice actress Tara Strong steals the spotlight many times as the voice of Dannan O'Mallard (well, Dannan herself steals the spotlight several times, to be fair), as well as Molly Winks, but all actors do wonderful jobs with their characters. And as if the vocal acting wasn't important enough, the computer animation is downright fantastic. And I'm not talking about that kind of Disney/Pixar show-off epic blockbuster "OMG LOOK WE'RE SO REALISTIC LOL WTF ^__^" animated graphics, no siree! The graphics are cartoony enough to give the flavour of fantasy and storytelling the show needs, and they look just simply adorable. With talented acting, masterful animation and intelligent writing, what more could you ask for?</p>

<p>The episodes have a great pace, and are adorned with brilliant, hilarious gags. You see, these aren't little cutesy "aww" chuckle-worthy gags made especially for children and children only (I better stop using that expression before I become repetitive and start repeating myself and being redundant and saying the same thing several times). No, these are truly <em>funny</em> jokes that come in strategically, to keep the story going without losing the interest from the kids. And every episode has a "subplot", that may or may not be tied in with the main plot, involving Wiley, the sheep. You see, he was imported from America, and is the only talking sheep in "his" flock. He's tried to get the flock into acting, singing, fitness, and even tried to write a book about him (because he's "a legend, and nobody knows it"). And we're talking about Mel Brooks, here, so you can bet you're in for a real treat.</p>

<p>Yes, I laugh out loud many times while watching <em>Jakers! The Adventures Of Piggley Winks</em>, and in fact, I almost feel like I can't get enough of it. I guess it's that feeling of utter excitement you get when you find out something new that's unlike anything you have ever seen, and looks like it was <em>made for you</em>. I do get this feeling from <em>Jakers!</em>, and I almost curse myself for not starting to watch it a long time ago. Fortunately, I managed to catch up and watch almost all episodes from the first season (my favourites being <em>Ferny Is A Bug</em>, <em>Picture Perfect</em>, <em>Molly's Dolly</em>, <em>Our Dragon's Egg</em> and the outstanding <em>Rock Around The Cluck</em>), and I was pleased to see that season 2 manages to improve on  several aspects of the show (almost all episodes are recommended). But enough raving. <em>Jakers!</em> is just spectacular, period. If you catch it on TV sometime, stop to watch it. You won't be disappointed. It might even make you think twice about kids' entertainment. But don't go watching <em>Barney</em>, expecting something as good!</p>

    Episode Reviews
</h2>

<p>Jakers! I suddenly realised I have watched most of these episodes a couple of times already! So why not provide reviews for each one of them? You see: so far, the series have two seasons, in a total of 31 episodes. But our channel hasn't showed all of the Season 2 episodes, so there are only 26 reviews here. But I hope these are enough. The episodes will be graded individually, so I can show my particular feelings towards them. But notice that, given the high standards of the show, a Jakers! <big>B-</big> would really be an <big>A</big> when compared to everything else. Or so I believe. An <big>A-</big> means a great episode, <big>A</big> means an awesome episode, and an <big>A+</big> is reserved only for a selected few. So let's stop chin wagging and go ahead.</p>

<h2>Season One</h2>

<p><strong>1.1 - Pie Filling:</strong> Definitely not bad for a start. This is here really to set up the main structure of an episode, so it hasn't the educational purposes of the latter episodes. The premise is very simple: Piggley and his friends end up devouring the pie his mother made for supper, and set off to make another one while she's away. Yet, even with such a simple plot, the execution is excellent: we already have a taste of the excellent animation, the excellent music, the characters and smart, lightweight humour - and Wiley, of course. The series didn't start with a "BANG" with this, but it was better this way: the better was yet to come. <big>B+</big></p>

<p><strong>1.2 - The Salmon Of Knowledge:</strong> Better already! It's Piggley being mischievous again, trying to find the legendary "Salmon Of Knowledge", so he doesn't have to study on the weekend for the Monday test. With this, we know more about Dannan and Ferny and their personalities - Dannan refuses to believe Piggley right from the beginning, and sticks to studying. Ferny is more guillible, so he tries to believe in the salmon before realising that he was wrong. Yep, definitely getting better. <big>A-</big></p>

<p><strong>1.3 - Ferny Is A Bug:</strong> Even better! Who would have guessed? This time, the story focuses in Piggley and Dannan's great friendship with Ferny, when they think he was turned into a bug by an upset fairy. We see more of the characters' personalities as actual <em>children</em>, with their beliefs and ingenuity. It is both funny and touching to see Piggley trying to feed "Ferny", and hiding him in his mouth from his father. And the scene when they think he was eaten by the chickens is unbelievable. One of the finest episodes this season. <big>A</big></p>

<p><strong>1.4 - The Case Of Big Sty:</strong> Hmm, not as good, really. I think this is just too slow paced and restricted, and not energic. And guess what? <em>Too little Dannan!</em> As much as I love Piggley and Ferny, when Dannan is not around, you'll definitely feel it. But the episode has more than enough redeeming qualities, so it's still fun to watch. Piggley interrogating Ferny and Dannan is worth a watch. <big>B+</big></p>

<p><strong>1.5 - All Night Long:</strong> Easily one of the <em>funniest</em> episodes this season. And the interesting aspect is that most of it happens in Piggley's room, in a single night, and it's even funnier than, say, 'Pie Filling'. It's just about Piggley, Dannan and Ferny willing to go fishing with his father next morning, and trying to give him reasons to think they're responsible, but they always end up screwing up the plans. The pillow fight, the radio blasting out loud music in the middle of the night, and the fishing fight with Wiley are a real scream. Yep, even the Wiley subplot is extra funny. "Look, she's got a handle! Like a pump!" <big>A-</big></p>

<p><strong>1.6 - Picture Perfect:</strong> Another peak! Another one that's funny and touching, but this time, we witness the first fight between Piggley and Ferny - over a certain embarrassing picture Piggley took. The way the episode flows is such that not a single second is wasted, and all events going on are either hilarious or heartbreaking. You gotta love Piggley's attempts at fixing the problem, only to see things getting screwed up further. Great conclusion, too. <big>A</big></p>

<p><strong>1.7 - Teacher Creature:</strong> Mr. Hornsby is coming to Piggley's house for dinner! What now? That's gotta be a nightmare for any kid, and that's exactly what happens here. The characters are, again, excellently handled, and it's just fun to watch the story unfold itself. The kids "cleaning" the kitchen, and trying to get an apple, only to get ejected right into the stratosphere and into the moon ("Hold on, Grampa!") are certainly worth a watch. I don't even remember what was Wiley's subplot, here, but whatever it was, it was probably funny. <big>A-</big></p>

<p><strong>1.8 - Molly's Dolly:</strong> Another awesome one, it's one of the best examples of true storytelling on the show. It's about Molly's new leprechaun doll, which Piggley is led to believe is a <em>real</em> leprechaun. Once again, the story unfolds in a fantastic way, funny all the way through, and most of all: unpredictable. It's one of the least straightforward episodes on the show. Wiley's Flock Fitness Week is a scream, and the conclusion of the episode is, once again, saved by excellent writing. One of the essential episodes. <big>A</big></p>

<p><strong>1.9 - Song Of The Banshee:</strong> Geez, this show is on a roll. Here, Dannan is on the spotlight (and you <em>know</em> that's a good thing), with every element of the story being great on its own, and contributing the big "whole" of the story. It's funny to see Piggley willing to investigate the "Banshee", while being frozen by fear when actually doing it. It's yet another awesome episode, and it's a shame I can't watch this one with the original voices. The dubbing doesn't suck, but we just have plain "dubbers" here, while the original has actual <em>actors</em>. And Dannan's voice is grating - imagine that. <big>A</big></p>

<p><strong>1.10 - Our Dragon's Egg:</strong> The final episode in an amazing stretch of <em>three</em> awesome episodes, this one is yet another hilarious and utterly unbelievable one. When Piggley finds an egg that's just <em>too</em> big to be true, they figure it can only be the egg of a dragon, and failing to find the "mother", they find themselves having to hatch it. While not being drenched in the storytelling cleverness of the two previous episodes, it's funny, and keeps you attached. We witness Ferny's skills with songs for the first time, too, and Wiley thinking he's the egg's mother is one of the highpoints here. You can't go wrong with that. <big>A</big></p>

<p><strong>1.11 - The Cat Came Back... And Back:</strong> The irony here is that, while this is Mom's favourite story, this is my least favourite episode so far. And it's a shame, because I love cats. Hector is given quite a lot of spotlight, but since his character isn't developed yet, he comes across as just plain annoying. And the Miss Nanny's cat constantly coming back makes the episode a little too predictable. But you can't miss the scene where Piggley and Dannan take the "baby" to town. And Wiley falling in love with "Meow", thinking she's a little sheep? Priceless. <big>B</big></p>

<p><strong>1.12 - Good Neighbors:</strong> We meet Fergal O'Hopper, who Piggley believes is a mad scientist... even though he's only a kid, too. It's definitely better than the previous episode, and it's a great way to introduce the character, too. Dealing with the kids's fears and fertile minds is a real treat, here, and the conclusion is very nice. You gotta love Fergal. <big>A-</big></p>

<p><strong>1.13 - Rock Around The Cluck:</strong> Rock and roll, dude! I mean, literally! This episode is about Piggley discovering Rock and Roll, and making his own band. How can't it possibly <em>not</em> totally rule? Easily the best episode of the season, at least to me. It's <em>such</em> a fun one: Molly "playing" the fiddle, Piggley going to school on Saturdays and being afraid to tell his friends, the Raloo Rockers' rehearsal, and the concert in the end... Woof, you'll have to love it. <big>A+</big></p>

<p><strong>1.14 - Donkeys Into Racehorses:</strong> It would be easy to have a disappointment after such an exceptional episode, but a disappointment this one's not! While it's not an unstoppable onslaught of fun like 'Our Dragon's Egg', for example, it's priceless at moments. Wiley shines here, and my favourite moment's got to be when Piggley puts "special shoes" on Finnegan, the donkey. <big>A-</big></p>

<p><strong>1.15 - Fir Not:</strong> When I first watched it, I felt there was a bit of wasted potential in this episode - as in, they were able to take dead simple premises and make wonders with them, and that didn't seem to happen here. But I figured it was because I missed the best bits of the episode. You see, Piggley learns about the mischievous Fir Darrig, that runs around making all sorts of mischievous things. So, he and his friends set out to catch it, but end up breaking a window because of it. And obviously, they blame Fir Darrig for it, only to find themselves haunted by him... or so they think. It's a fairly typical setting, but who really steals the spotlight here is - believe it or not - Wiley. At last, his scenes <em>truly</em> tie up perfectly with the main plot, and the sheep chasing the pie under Wiley's narration is easily one of the most hilarious scenes in the entire season. Worth a watch just because of that. <big>A-</big></p>

<h2>Season Two</h2>

<p><strong>2.1 - The Legend Of Raloo:</strong> Wow!! Isn't this, like, way too early on the season to deliver such a spectacular episode? This one deals with a delicate topic: Ferny's nationality. After Piggley hears an exciting story about an Irish hero, he decides to act it out with Dannan on Ferny. But since Ferny's dad is Spanish, he'll have to be the bad guy... and he doesn't like it. The second act of the episode is, <em>by far</em>, the most heartbreakingly and gutwrenchingly sad moment of the series so far, with Ferny being chased by his friends until he snaps at them and says he doesn't want to play anymore. And the ending is the most uplifting so far, when Ferny finds out about the Spanish heroes of the past, and shares it with their friends. At times, I wonder if this is way too emotionally charged for 3-7 year old kids, but this is easily a good episode to show to North American kids when they start thinking about Afghan and Iraqi kids. <big>A+</big></p>

<p><strong>2.2 - Sheep About Town:</strong> And we follow the most emotionally powerful episode so far with the <em>funniest</em> episode so far, and probably the funniest Jakers! episode I've ever seen. Seriously, this was the first one I watched, and I don't need to say it got me hooked quickly. It deals with the moment when a kid wants to be responsible and important, which Piggley does here. But his beginnings as a shepherd aren't very smooth... Seeing him whistling at the poor sheep's ears and switching pastures every minute is hysterical, until Wiley makes a plan and runs away... And now, they'll have to catch him. The chase in the school and in the town are one of the highest points on the show. "Eh, we're not gonna be graded for that, are we?" Yes, Dannan, you are: <big>A</big></p>

<p><strong>2.3 - Treasure Hunt:</strong> I had mixed feelings on this one for a while, until I watched it again and decided myself: it's great. I think it's just a bit questionable how Mr. Winks put all those clues for the treasure, and it puts the credibility of the show in risk... but hey, it's a bloody cartoon. And it's another funny episode. Wiley trying to fetch the tresure makes a great subplot (even with the totally unnecessary scene of him being run over by the flock - twice), and the kids going through all the steps of the hunt is a real treat. Notice the brilliant dialogue and character interaction all the way through - that <em>makes</em> the episode, for me. "Quiet, Ferny, I'm trying to think!" Priceless. And great music, too! I'd love to have a soundtrack CD of the show. Or better: a DVD with both seasons. Yep. <big>A</big></p>

<p><strong>2.4 - Milk Melodrama:</strong> Almost as strong as the previous ones: it just weakens a little on the second half. But before that, with Piggley trying different strategies to sell more of his father's milk is brilliant, and the "Blue Milk" part is genius. Only when they go to town to sell the milk with Ferny's jingle the episode kind of loses the momentum. But otherwise, it's a great episode, and it's very fun to see Wiley trying to "improve" his flock with colour. The ending with the flock's ballet is obvious, obvious filler, but how can I resist it when it's so funny? And a catchy jingle, indeed. Kudos to Ferny. <big>A-</big></p>

<p><strong>2.5 -  New Best Friends:</strong> More characters on the spotlight, when Mr. Hornsby instructs the children to make a work for shcool outside, with different partners. Dannan and Gosford compete with each other for a while, before realising it's better to work together; Ferny doesn't feel confident being Fergal's leader, before they start having fun and he finds out the young bunny boy wants to be like him; and Piggley has to work with Hector, of all people, before noticing there's a lot about him he doesn't know yet. It's a brilliant way of working all characters and so many different situations, and Wiley with the young sheep makes an adorably funny subplot. It's a beautiful episode, even though it's not as funny as the previous ones. But kudos for the sheer beauty of it. <big>A</big></p>

<p><strong>2.6 - No Girls Allowed:</strong> I didn't have high expectations for this one: Ooh, Piggley and Ferny join a club of horror storytellers where girls can't enter, and when Dannan finds out about it, she shows how much better she is than all other boys! Yep, seen that before. But... well, that's not <em>quite</em> what happened. The episode was worked out much better than that, and it surprised me. The scene at the end, with Dannan and Molly haunting the meeting was much better than I initially imagined. And the sole scene with Gosford <em>trying</em> to tell his horror tale is worth the entire episode. <big>A-</big></p>

<p><strong>2.7 - For Whom The Bell Trolls:</strong> Another solid one, with Hector playing yet another trick on the kids, but pushing it a bit too far. He eats the pie Ferny was supposed to bring to school that day, and after finding out about Hector's dirty trick, they set out to outtrick him. And the result is great, as usual. The result avoids the clich&eacute;s of other shows by actually <em>feeling</em> real - which is, of course, a strength in ever episode of the series. Gotta love Wiley trying to transform his flock into a group of actors! One of the funniest Wiley subplots so far. <big>A-</big></p>

<p><strong>2.8 - Extra! Extra!:</strong> Great! Another great way of working the three characters around the simple premise of making a piece of news for school. Piggley decides it's better to make up an exciting story, while Ferny makes a relatively "true" story out of his ingenuity. But Dannan tries to be more honest, and ends up revealing a surprising feat by Hector: bringing a lost baby sheep to his mother. There's no need to mention that Wiley was involved in that, is there? I just find Dannan's ability to write the news a little questionable - it gave me the impression they were making a sort of Lisa Simpson out of Dannan, but it's nothing grand. <big>A</big></p>

<p><strong>2.9 - Ferny Gets A Crush:</strong> Yep, Ferny gets a crush, and we finally know more about Millie: the young girl that had appeared many times before, but was never truly featured. Now, try to imagine the loveliest Jakers! episode possible. Double the loveliness, subtract all the cheesiness, and you get 'Ferny Gets A Crush'. It's both unstoppably hilarious and heartwarming. The scene with Ferny going three dozen times to Mr. Hornsby's desk to sharpen his pencils to call Millie's attention; Dannan making a knight out him so he can rescue a 'damsel in distress' ("Dannan, what's a damsel?"); Ferny giving her the gifts, while Dannan and Piggley play "romantic music" a bit too loud - that's one of the best scenes, with Piggley's happy major-key tune suddenly turning minor-key and sad when she runs away. Genius! The episode is fantastic all the way through, and even Wiley's subplot, being the "Knight" of the flock contributes to the fun... Bah, there are too many honourable things about the episode to be told in one paragraph. The conclusion is wonderful, and this is definitely the best showcase for Ferny on the series. <big>A+</big></p>

<p><strong>2.10 - My Right Arm:</strong> Piggley broke his arm, and now, he's not sure if he's able to participate on the ball throwing contest, which he wins every year. To make matters worse (or better?), his arm starts itching below the cast, thanks to Hector. Well, this is definitely a great episode about making bad things become good, and it's very fun to watch. Not a highlight, but a solid episode. I think I watched this only once, so forgive me for not remembering too much about it. But as it is, it's a certain <big>A-</big>.</p>

<p><strong>2.11 - Lucky U:</strong> And this <em>is</em> a highlight, about the kids working together to find out how Mr. Hornsby's lucky horsheshow got its luck: from a blacksmith who defeated a dragon? From fairies? Or from a unicorn? Watch it as the kids try to find it out. It's another excellent episode, and lovely all the way through. It's definitely the big, uplifting message of the episode that makes it so wonderful. <big>A</big></p>

<p>The following episodes haven't aired here, yet, but I'm definitely looking forwards to 'Trial And Error', 'Molly Had A Little Lamb' and 'Dannan's American Cousin'. I'll add the reviews as soon as I watch the remaining six, so hang on tight!</p>
