    About me!
</h1>

<div class="intro">
  So, I suppose there should be a picture of me right here, am I correct? So...<br />
  <img alt="Fernie Canto, a.k.a. Sir Mustapha" src="http://www.midicorner.hpg.ig.com.br/MR_SNAKE.JPG" /><br />
  Ping! More on this pic later.
</div>

<p>Ok, since it sounds so much fun, let's do this <em>About Me</em> page Q&amp;A style! Here we go? Here we go.</p>

<p>Q: What about the picture above?<br />
A: I said MORE ON THIS PIC <em>LATER</em>.</p>

<p>Q: Are you an Arab?<br />
A: No! I live in South America, in the country popularly known as Brazil; at the very South, in a town called Porto Alegre. It's one of the best towns in the world, by the way.</p>

<p>Q: So, why the nickname 'Sir Mustapha'?<br />
A: Because of the universally famous Queen hit-single 'Mustapha'. I came up with it by the time I was making my AOL screen name (sic!), and since there was a "Mustapha" already, I stuck in "Sir" in front of it for a change. And then it stuck.</p>

<p>Q: What's your real name, then?<br />
A: Fernando Henrique Canto, named after former president Cardoso 9 years before he was elected. Or so my father said. But folks usually call me "Fernie" instead, so I kinda adopted this name. Fernie, Ferny, Fernando, it's all fine by me.</p>

<p>Q: What about the picture, then?<br />
A: <em>LATER</em>.</p>

<p>Q: What do you do for a living?<br />
A: At the moment, I just finished a Technical Course in computer programming, and I have a job in the university. I'm putting the knowledge I acquired on the course into practice, and it's quite nice. Plus, I'm having financial return from it. Could I ask for more? Sure.</p>

<p>Q: What motivated you to make a reviews page?<br />
A: Well, being a musician myself, I <em>love</em> talking about music. And I like expressing my opinions. So, I think it would be interesting if I exposed my feelings on music to whomever is concerned - since everyone's doing it anyway. Also... I didn't want to waste my Web space in Geocities.</p>

<p>Q: Are you really a musician?<br />
A: Pretty much - that is, if you're not a bloody <em>elitist</em> who thinks it's not enough to produce 3 CDs worth of original music and think you <em>need</em> to make Music College to be called a musician. But I think I am. I play the keyboards myself, and I have been writing music in the computer for quite some time. It's all instrumental music played mostly on synthesized MIDI sounds, and my albums (<strong>Musics For Highways</strong>, <strong>The Binary Sounds Of Nature</strong> and <strong>Concerto Schizophrenia II: "Buses"</strong>) are available for FREE DOWNLOAD on <a href="http://ferniecanto.imdanet.com">my MP3 site</a>. <em>Download them</em>.</p>

<p>Q: What kinds of music do you like?<br />
A: Well, I like <em>good</em> music. Forgive me for the unforgivable clich&eacute;, but that's pretty much true. I can like mostly any genre of music, provided it's <em>good</em>, and displays talent and originality. I love rock music, I like reggae (Bob Marley's da king, mon), I like good Brazilian samba, I like some experimental stuff, some avant-garde stuff... well, you know the drift.</p>

<p>Q: What are your favourite bands?<br />
A: Well, the band that's responsible for bringing me into liking music is Queen, via their <strong>Greatest Hits</strong> CD. From there, I can mention The Beatles and The Who; Pink Floyd, Yes, King Crimson, Rush, The Moody Blues and all that prog art rock crap; some "novelty" acts like Wire, Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band, The Residents; and solo artists like Ben Arion, Brain One, Ben O'rian and, of course, Brian Eno; Mike Oldfield, Jean-Michel Jarre... and there's also Radiohead, my favourite 90's band. Presto. I think I covered it all.</p>

<p>Q: What's with the little quotes on top of your review pages?<br />
A: Those are quotes I made up myself (most times), relative to how I think the artists behave. They're just there for a comical/humourous appeal (most times), and are not meant to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>Q: And what's with the South Park designs, anyway?<br />
A: Those are part of a little joke. Since I didn't have any band photos, I decided to make my own using a nifty South Park Create-A-Character you can find <a href="http://images.southparkstudios.com/games/create/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Q: What else do you do aside from half-arsed music reviews?<br />
A: Well, aside from composing music and writing about music, I like to write and read fanfiction for the best television comedy series of all time, The Simpsons. Yeah, I used to watch the show religiously before it hit rock bottom with seasons 13 and 14, and I was responsible for some fanfiction, too. I belong to a group of friends who go under the name of the <a href="http://www.simpworks.com">Groening FanWorks Central</a>, formed by people who write and draw for The Simpsons and Futurama. They're great people, and they accept your fanfiction if it's good and if you post it there. Give the website a look. We are all nerds, of course, but we're varied enough.</p>

<p>Q: So, you <em>are</em> a fan of Lisa Simpson, anyway?<br />
A: <em>Absolutely</em>. I could go on for hours talking about good ol' Lisa, but suffice to say, I think she's the best character to grace television. That's just <em>me</em>, of course, but it is what I think. My heart is filled with joy and love whenever I hear her name or see her on the (computer or television) screen. She just plain rocks.</p>

<p>Q: And what kind of people like cartoon 8-year-old girls so much?<br />
A: 1) Sentimental, sensitive people; 2) Paedophilians; 3) Horny pubescent 14-year-olds; 4) Schizophrenic psychopats. I fit in cathegories 1 and 4.</p>

<p>Q: O... kay. How can I find you on the Internet?<br />
A: You can <a href="mailto:sirmustapha@gmail.com">mail me</a>, or find me on ICQ with the uin 168886542 on Saturdays and Sundays. I usually visit the aforementioned <a href="http://www.simpworks.com">Groening FanWorks Central</a> forums, the <a href="http://tubular.net">Tubular.net</a> Mike Oldfield forums, and <a href="http://www.eboards4all.com/841116">Music Babble</a>. I always go under the names SirMustapha, Mr Snake or plain Fernando.</p>

<p>Q: So, what about the picture above?<br />
A: Well... it was taken at our beach house in the Easter holiday, 2003. My sister had just taken a snapshot of her boyfriend (she just said "hi" from behind him, and as he turned to look, *snap*), and as she walked, by, I asked her to take a photo of me - and just in time, I stuck my tongue out. That's really how I look like in my "laid back" form. You can't see my face very clearly, but that's probably a good thing, anyway.</p>

<p>Q: Are you single?<br />
A: We shall see.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time. Now, if you allow me, let me go back to the shadows, where I belong.</p>
