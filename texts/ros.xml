<p>Iceland has produced, so far in the history of mankind, three very big and famous things: Bj&ouml;rk, <em>Lazy Town</em>, and Sigur R&oacute;s. This makes the score 2 x 1 on the battle of Good versus Evil. Sigur R&oacute;s, however, ended up being a very "convenient" representative of Iceland, because their music is different, exotic, unusual. Okay, so is Bj&ouml;rk, but she defies basically every convention there is. Sigur R&oacute;s music <em>sounds</em> like it came from a distant, isolated country covered with ice and snow. It <em>breathes</em> cold air. Therefore, it has always been easy to embrace this band as something truly fresh and "out there".</p>

<p>Thing is, the sound of this band is not a product of Iceland's low temperature, and it's <em>not</em> crafted to be so. It is merely a unique identity, a sound that's meant to satisfy only their own musical aspirations. This became easier to see as they put out more and more albums. So, always take with a grain of salt those reviews that try to forcefully link Sigur R&oacute;s to anything related to snow. Just ignore it. Yes, their sound, especially in the beginning of their career, <em>is</em> based on slow and sparse rhythms, airy and rarefied textures based on organs, keyboards and guitars, and high pitched sounds (particularly J&oacute;n &THORN;or Birgisson's singing, which is usually falsetto-heavy). But their music goes far beyond that.</p>

<p>As for the "Post Rock" label they received: okay, so that is an annoying label. Mogwai is considered "Post Rock", but Sigur R&oacute;s sounds nothing like them. For one, their music is not largely instrumental, and even though the songs are usually long, they are not based on repetitive, slowly growing patterns. The song structures here are more conventional &mdash; it's the sound and the texture that's different. Personally, the Post Rock association is meaningless. It's much better to simply take the band as something different from everything else, and avoid comparisons. If they can be compared to other artists, Mogwai and the like are not the better option.</p>

<p>In the beginning, the band were a trio, with J&oacute; &THORN;or Birgisson handling vocal and guitar duties, Georg H&ouml;lm on bass and drummer &Aacute;gust &AElig;var Gunnarson. There would be two line-up changes later on: an added keyboardist, and a change of drummers. After that, the line-up remained very stable.]]></text>

      <review><![CDATA[
<p>Okay, so if you've only heard a few of the band's most famous albums (e.g. [a]&Aacute;g&aelig;tis byrjun[/a]), or if you haven't heard anything at all, this review will be equally relevant. Forget anything you've heard about the band: this album is experimental, exploratory, and completely uncompromised. The most noteworthy thing about it, though, is that the band has pretty much disowned it. In fact, it feels like they <em>hate</em> the album, and the reason is that it didn't came out quite the way they wanted, due to tight deadlines among other things. I have no idea what <em>exactly</em> the band aimed for originally, and I guess we'll never know. One thing is for sure: some of these tracks (mainly the title track and [s]Hafss&oacute;l[/s]) got heavily reworked in the following years, but those new versions have nothing to do with the sound we've got in [a]Von[/a]: instead of the soaring strings and crushing crescendos, we have a more oppressive, heavy atmosphere, with odd electronic experiments and harsher rhythms.</p>

<p>The majority of the album, however, is taken by pseudo-ambient instrumental work-outs, far more based on texture than on melody. [s]Sigur R&oacute;[/s], which opens the album, is extremely illustrative: long, creepy and dark. [s]D&ouml;gun[/s] follows suit on a slightly lighter note, but the experimental vein keeps running strong here. But not every track is like that: some of them have a more conventional structure, even featuring vocals, but the sound never becomes more conventional. The most "song-like" track here is [s]Myrkur[/s], and it's a big highlight, with its slightly muffled sound and ghostly floating vocals. It's [s]really[/s] good. The title track is more laid back and tranquil, and the only moment in the album that breathes a bit of peace, and it manages that with a sing-along-y melody and banging percussion. The lyrics are written not in Icelandic, but a gibberish invented "language", consisting only of a few different syllables, which the papers labelled as "Vonlesk&aacute;", that is, "Hopelandic" ("von", in Icelandic, means "hope"). When you read about Sigur R&oacute;s, you'll read a lot about "Hopelandic", so keep in mind: that is what it stands for.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, both [s]Hafss&oacute;l[/s] and [s]Syndir Gu&eth;s[/s] go for a more "ambient" feel; the former has some verses in the beginning sung over a hazey atmosphere, and then gradually builds rhythm and momentum but without ever going above the "atmospheric" level, and the latter has J&oacute;nsi's now trademark falsetto vocals over a droning drum and bass thingy. The only "aggressive" song here is [s]H&uacute;n J&oacute;r&eth;[/s], which really stands out for its menacing atmosphere and sudden ourbursts. They are all beautiful works, perhaps only outstaying their welcome, and not having a very polished and well-crafted production. Everywhere else, you have these short instrumental pieces, like the percussion-crazy [s]Ver&ouml;ld, n&yacute; &oacute;g &oacute;&eth;[/s], the chimy [s]Mistur[/s] and the strange-tune-played-entirely-backwards [s]Leit a&eth; l&iacute;fi[/s]. I admit, this stuff doesn't really cause a <em>great</em> impression in me. But they are all nice, and they hardly will annoy you. It just leaves me wondering how much of it was "artistic vision", how much of it was "studio trickery" and how much of it was "we have to get this bloody thing done in no time", as the band often alleges. And, really, [s]Rukrym[/s]? It's just a small portion os [s]Myrkur[/s] played backwards, after a long stretch of silence. A "hidden track"? Who knows. I have no justifications for a <em>low</em> rating, but this 10 I'm giving is certainly not striving to reach any higher. Yes, it is a very <em>interesting</em> album and worth listening to at least once, and I can't say I won't ever listen to it again. But do I feel like going back to it? Well, there are many albums in my collection that I haven't heard in a long time, but it's not out of neglect, and merely a question of "moving on", y'know? In this case... if I listen to it again, it will probably be mostly due to curiousity. But that is no insult.</p>

<p>And before you ask: no, there is nothing "hidden" in [s]18 sek&uacute;ndur fyrir s&oacute;laruppr&aacute;s[/s]: it's just 18 seconds of silence, nothing more.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
<p>And this means change. And the changes aren't that subtle. What basically happened is that the band <em>dropped</em> their attempts to make "ambient" music and changed the focus towards fully fleshed-out, structured <em>songs</em> &mdash; of course, using that strict definition of "song". But almost all of these tracks are "conventional" tunes (yeah, conventional alright!), only with a few odd bits of sonic exploration and whatnot &mdash; but they're reserved to track transitions, slow and gradual intros, that kind of thing. What happens is that Sigur R&oacute;s finally decided to stop fooling around and do things <em>their own way</em>. Oh, and they added a keyboardist to their ranks, Kjartan Sveinsson, who could read music and write orchestral arrangaments, so that probably helped.</p>

<p>But enough babbling. With this album, it's useless to get lost in endless chatter, and it's much more productive to get straight to the point. The fact is that the band got quite ambitious at this point. Suddenly, you have an onslaught of strings, horns, orchestras and choirs, long songs, loud and bombastic climaxes and sonic landscapes that aren't modest <em>at all</em>. But I'm yet to see an album with strings, horns, orchestras and choirs that sounds as <em>natural</em> as this one does. You know, it's quite amazing, but this album doesn't sound too ambitious and/or too pompous for its own sake. But maybe <em>I</em> am not used to this kind of music. When you listen to stuff like [a]Quadrophenia[/a], you'd expect everything else to be pompous and bombastic, and this album is <em>not</em>. I guess Icelandic people don't listen to The Who all that much, after all.</p>

<p>The annoying thing is that this album sounds <em>exactly</em> like what you'd expect to hear from a country named Iceland. Everything here is very quiet, very icy (well, not quite icy... <em>snowy</em> is a better definition) and very slow. Sometimes there are very atmospheric synthesizers humming around, and other times Kjartan plays piano or organ. J&oacute;nsi is always using his unique falsetto (Coldplay? Pff! You ain't heard <em>anything</em> yet) to sing odd, beautiful little melodies and making his guitar howl with a cello bow, while &Aacute;gust brushes or taps his drums in a very slow pace, and Georg plays mantraic lines in his bass guitar. And that's the "signature" sound of [a]&Aacute;g&aelig;tis Byrjun[/a], and the songs are very rooted in that. But still, each song manages to stand out somehow. Some of them are louder, others are scarier, others are uplifting, and so on. There are string sections sometimes, there are horns played depressed Jazzy things other times, and all of that. But basically, the entire album has that sound of chilly air.</p>

<p>But I didn't start talking about the songs themselves! And this is where the goodies start to come. These songs are <em>brilliant</em>! Some more, some less, but they're all great &mdash; so much, that it's even hard to decide where to begin. Well... Well, I did talk about the album's "sound", and if you want the best places to look for this "sound", try the opening song, [s]Svefn-g-englar[/s]. The solemn organ chords mix up with a sonar-like *PING* sound (sorta like the [s]Echoes[/s] *PING* severely slowed down and reverb'd all the way to oblivion), sounding like underwater, where J&oacute;nsi's vocal melody drifts. There's a very exotic hook in the chorus that's extremely catchy <em>because</em> it's exotic, and it paces slowly through all its eight or nine minutes. This song is the kind of thing a more boring band would want to keep under 4 minutes and issue as a single. But Sigur R&oacute;s leave the song develop and run naturally, and the result is wonderful. The same happens with [s]Flugufrelsarinn[/s], one of the most gorgeous tracks here. The song flow is so perfect and unadultered, it's hard to believe that it runs for <em>eight</em> minutes. See what I mean when I say the band doesn't sound ambitious? The <em>songs</em> are like this, and that's it. And if you notice, the structure is the same structure of a regular pop tune, yet if you tried to make it shorter, it would simply lose its gentleness, its beauty and even its uplifting, cathartic power every time they reach that melody in the "chorus". This is one of the most uplifting tracks here, even.</p>

<p>And then, there's [s]Star&aacute;lfur[/s], that also has a beautiful vocal line, but this time is aided by an orchestra, and the arrangement for strings truly stand out. The simple melody they play truly <em>soars</em>, and the dreamy atmosphere of the song helps lots. But after the bright, uplifting spots are over, we're left with [s]N&yacute; batter&iacute;[/s], one of the most anguished, most unnerving songs I know. The sound of the brass ensemble here is unlike anything else, and the mood of the song somehow manages to go from completely hopeless to absolutely terrified. It's unbelievable! The horns sulking around the corners all the time and the stop-and-go structure might make you start wondering if The Cure are as depressing as you once thought they were.</p>

<p>[s]Hjarta&eth; hamast[/s] keeps the angry and hostile mood, with a "pumping" rhythm and Kjartan on the electric piano playing on a region somewhere in between Rick Wright and Vangelis, and a sad-sounding chorus with strings, unfocused vocals, and it all ends with a horribly frightening sound effect, like the world ended without warning. After that one, the album becomes quite uplifting again, and you have <em>The Real Big Deal</em> of the album: the three-song-stretch formed by tracks 7, 8 and 9. Yeah, man, <em>this</em> is the real big thing &mdash; and not only figuratively speaking, since [s]Vi&eth;rar vel til loft&aacute;r&aacute;sa[/s] is the longest song in here. You might have seen the video of this one already, and if you did, you'll agree with me when I say the song is <em>motherfuckingly awesome</em>. And it isn't just because of the loud, bombastic ending it has, at least not in my opinion. Kjartan's piano in the opening of the song <em>completely</em> does it for me, and when the strings kick in, the recipe is done... And then the drums enter thescene, and J&oacute;nsi comes in with a surprisingly untrivial melody, and Kjartan insists in playing those <em>perfect</em> combinations of notes on his piano. This construct goes way, way beyond a mere "crescendo". If the song were only this, it would already be incredible, but <em>then</em> the band has to show its immense power in achieving Earth-shattering climaxes, and the whole thing is an immediate touchdown. But of course, they aren't happy in just getting you weepy and all lighter-waving-above-your-head like, and they screw up the ending with such gusto that it's pretty chilling. I bet Mike Oldfield wouldn't have enough guts to pull off <em>this</em> trick in his so beloved [s]Far Above The Clouds[/s].</p>

<p>Keeping up with the streak of gorgeousness, [s]Olsen Olsen[/s] begins innocently enough with a pleasant two-note bass line and J&oacute;nsi using his freak voice to sing "lyrics" in "Hopelandic". It all sounds beautiful enough when, without warning, the song switches into a grandiose celebration of orchestras, choirs and splashing drums playing a <em>wonderful</em> little melody with a sort of whiff of Italian traditional tunes that I just can't put my finger on. And it all sounds so defyingly <em>simple</em> and na&iuml;ve, it truly does sound otherworldly. And then, to close everything, we have a surprisingly relaxed and pleasant ballad, the title track. Now <em>this</em> truly does remind me of Pink Floyd, with its slow rhythm, guitar pickings and pleasant melody. And it's beautiful, and ends the album in a nice, relaxed tone. The lyrics are basically the story behind the making of [a]Von[/a], and the disappointment at the end. But then, J&oacute;nsi remembers that it was "an okay beginning", after all. And it sure was. It almost sounds like the song is an <em>apology</em> from the band. Can you imagine that? A band, in their own album, giving a message of "we're sorry, folks, we really blew it last time around, but we'll try to make it better this time around". It's either a very humble or a very smart move, or both! Either way, they surely made it up for <em>anything</em> that [a]Von[/a] could have possibly done wrong.</p>

<p>But looking again at the album, it's clear that the band didn't <em>completely</em> abandon the ideas behind [a]Von[/a], or else, how would you explain the noisy transitions between tracks, and especially the album's four-minute outro, [s]Avalon[/s]? It sure does sound "ambient" like, even though it's nothing but an orchestral take from [s]Star&aacute;lfur[/s] slowed down four or five times. Even the introduction of the album is just a section of the title track reversed and played on a loop (remember [s]Rukrym[/s]?), but the deal is that the band severely reduced the importance of those ambient things. Maybe they realised they're much better writing "songs", and <em>fortunately</em> they did so.</p>]]></review>

Agaetis Byrjun - 10<br />
Best Song- Svefn-G-Englar<br />
I can't rate the songs individually. This album obviously isn't meant to have the songs separated, they're supposed to be taken as an album. After all, it's way too hard to remember individual tracks when they're so goddamn long. This is a fucking great album though.<br />
Warning: The Sigurs aren't a catchy pop band. Not that being a catchy pop band or being NOT a catchy pop band is a bad thing, but there's only one melody I can really remember afterwards. The rest surprises me every time I listen, and the melodies are huge and epic and grandiose and beautiful, the string sections and synths are fantastic touches. The album starts with some ambient minute-long intro, that sounds like the album is skipping. Then it segues into one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. I've heard people saying this song is really boring and long, and awful, but they approach it the wrong way. Sigur Ros isn't a band to sing along to, or to rock out to, or really do anything other than rest, sleep, or just listen to. The first time I heard Svefn-G-Englar it was on a cold afternoon bus ride to Canada on a vacation, and the song is just gorgeous. The vocalist, who should not be compared to Thom Yorke, sings this wonderfully simple but beautiful vocal hook, "a-tijuuuuuuuu". I don't get this, why it's so beautiful or entracing, but it is.<br />
(The music, post-rock, doesn't mean "after rock", but I appreciate your thinking, Ferno. Post-Rock tends to be instrumental, with layered simple guitar parts twisted into epic song structures. Check out Mogwai, Godspeed You! Black Emporer, and Explosions In The Sky.) <span class="edNote">[editor's note: Yeah, I guess you are right. I just thought of "Post Rock" relating to the ruins of Rock music the same way "Post Punk" relates to the ruins of Punk Rock, so I thought my description was adequate, but I know what you mean.]</span><br />
The rest of the album comes as a long, epic, beautiful, atmospheric trip through some kind of surreal ice world. (Ice Land? HEE.) Individual songs aren't important, it's the full effect. It's goddamn entrancing. The guitars don't sound like what you'd think a guitar would sound like, even more icy and atmospheric than Johnny Greenwood's (for the sake of Radiohead comparisons) best ambient impressions. The drums are light and rarely obtrusive, the bass is hidden deep between the gorgeous string sections and synths, and really makes only one lead appearance, for a sexy(saxxy?) jazzy jam with a saxophone in Ny Batteri. Olsen Olsen has possibly the most epic melody outside of classical music, and it has nothing to do with twin teenage whores, as far as I can remember.<br />
This album is unique, or a unique band, don't let people tell you they're Radiohead rip-offs. for all of Thom Yorke's alien-posturing, he can't reach Jon in terms of pure, strange, beautiful, vocals. As I said up there, 10. Get it, if you have any interest in beautiful music, or post-rock, which could be considered the modern prog. Just another form of classical rock, only relying on simplicity, beauty, and power rather than complexity, pretentiousness, and singing like an elf.]]></comment>

      <review><![CDATA[
<p>Whoa. If people (me included) didn't think there was much reason to consider Sigur R&oacute;s a "depressing" band, here's one EP to prove them all wrong and make them look like dunces (I said <em>me included</em>!). This is, in fact, the release that made the band truly break it big outside Iceland, particularly in the UK. After all, the whole Post Rock thing was quite "in", you know, and this EP fits the whole Post Rock schtick quite well &mdash; though the band themselves didn't do it on purpose.</p>

<p>As it's obvious already, the big centrepiece of the EP is [s]N&yacute; batter&iacute;[/s], which is the same version already released on [a]&Aacute;g&aelig;tis byrjun[/a], but don't think that that makes the EP superfluous to those who already own the album. There are two reasons. The first one is that the EP allows the song to gain a sort of life of its own, isolated from the album. The first track, [s]Rafmagni&eth; b&uacute;i&eth;[/s], is actually a five minute intro to the song, beginning gently with some tentative piano tinkling, and then building itself up with the plaintive, meanderng brass playing. The track really justifies its title ("Out of Electricity"), as it just <em>sounds</em> like darkness, before it brings the buzzing sound that leads us into the already familiar bass riff of [s]N&yacute; batter&iacute;[/s]. I already talked about the song on the previous review, but just to make sure, it's gorgeous. It's dark as <em>hell</em>, of course, but it's gorgeous.</p>

<p>There's one reason remaining, and it's actually two. The two tracks on side B are only available here and on the soundtrack of <em>Englar alheimsins</em>, or <em>Angels of the Universe</em>, and they keep up the trend of side A: dark, foreboding, and beautiful as damn. They're covers, in fact. [s]B&iacute;um b&iacute;um bambal&oacute;[/s] is a lullaby, well known in Iceland, and it seems Sigur R&oacute;s's version is the first ever recorded version of the tune. The tune is already not very bright and joyous, and it's given the usual Sigur R&oacute;s treatment: reticent percussion, bowed guitar, hollow chords and J&oacute;nsi's floating singing. The final result is a must have for fans, though it might pale in comparison to songs like [s]Flugufrelsarinn[/s] for the casual listener. I really like it, though, especially because the mood is dark but gentle &mdash; it's not very heavy, you see, even as it reaches its small climax near the end.</p>

<p>But that mood doesn't last for long. Just to give you the idea, the title of the last track translates as "Death Announcements and Funerals". Joyful, not? Actually, the song is an organ theme used by Icelandic radio services as background music for death announcements, and the band merrily went their way to borrow the song and record it. I'm not Icelandic and I don't know its radio services, but I guess that must be that kind of stuff that gives many a small kid nightmares &mdash; spooky organ music used to announce funerals, the voice of dead people speaking from the afterlife. Yeeouch! And I say that because the TV and the radio are capable of producing some truly scary and traumatasing stuff, like the <em>Screen Gems</em> logo and the <em>Viacom V of Doom</em>. Now, of course the band did not use the actual recording of the organ theme in the EP; they made <em>their own</em> rendition of the music. Simply because they <em>wanted</em> to! Ain't that <em>cruel</em>? I mean, if I were a kid and lived in Iceland, I'd probably be scared of that spooky organ tune. Imagine hearing <em>this</em>! I'd probably die. And yes, the band's rendition of the song is morbid as hell, featuring <em>brutal</em> quiet/loud dynamics a la Mogwai, heavy distorted guitars and suicidal drums bashing a "waltz" rhythm. The band insists that the song is "theme music" &mdash; and it is, after all &mdash; but of course the hip kids called it Post Rock. Go ahead, call it Post Rock if you wish. I still think it's cruel and evil. And I love it.</p>

<p>Well, okay, so not exactly <em>cruel and evil</em>. That was not the intent. These two songs, allegedly, are very ubiquitous and well remembered by the people in Iceland, so these recording must have had quite a massive effect. For people not in Iceland, this effect is diminished, but the music is brilliant nonetheless. So, it's an EP, but it's a neatly packed, carefully written and recorded EP. It might seem unfair to rank it next to other 12-rated full albums, but hey, it would be unfair to give it, say, a 9, just because it's 24 minutes long and not 40. Oh, well, it's a limited edition EP, anyway, so you probably won't even bother about it. I still recommend it to anyone who can check it out.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
<p>And if the band wasn't ambitious before, well, be prepared, because <em>this</em> is ambition. And, unsurprisingly, this album gets a 15 from me, because I am a pretentious dork. No need to question why, I just am.</p>

<p>It's true that this album kind of divided fans somewhat, and being the "follow-up" to the mega hit [a]&Aacute;g&aelig;tis byrjun</strong>, it would be inevitable that the question "what is better, [a]&Aacute;g&aelig;tis byrjun[/a] or [a]( )[/a]?" would become commonplace. And it did. But, whether you think this one is better or worse, you gotta give the band credit because they didn't churn out an album identical to the previous one just to please the critics and fans. This album, unlike that, has a clear concept, a clear goal and a clear ambition. It was the time for the band to truly test their limits, to find an identity of their own, and that's just what they did. In other terms, it couldn't have been a more perfect time for the band to release this album.</p>

<p>So, what is [a]( )[/a], you ask? Well... how can I explain? First and foremost, the album's most immediately striking feature is that it has <em>no title</em>. And not just that, but none of the tracks are titled, and the only words printed on the CD artwork is the handwritten name of the band. But that isn't gratuitous: <em>all</em> lyrics of the album are "written" in "Hopelandic", that is, everything J&oacute;nsi sings here means nothing at all. There are no "lyrics", and thus, the album is completely wordless. And you'd think that's quite fuckin' pretentious, but there's when I disagree with you, you stupid bastard.</p>

<p>Why? The thing is, it wasn't the band's intent to create a "meaningless" album. A "meaningless" album is supposed to mean absolutely nothing, and THAT, in my opinion, is a pretentious thing. Trying to remove any kind of meaning from art is negating the very essence of art; but there are artists who do that, and it's alright. I guess. But that's not what the band is doing here. They are not <em>negating</em> the meaning of their music, and only merely leaving it open and non explicit. They just made the music without explaining it, and so, it's up to the <em>listener</em> to find his own, personal meaning to the songs, to the album as a whole, and to write his own lyrics on the blank spaces in the album's booklet and to write his own name between those big parentheses. Is that pretentious? I don't think so, and I'll even say that's less pretentious than making an album with a supposed meaning. When you make art with a "meaning", you'd expect the listener to <em>understand</em> that meaning, and so you're giving your own art a sense of your own self-importance. It isn't the same when you make such an "incomplete" album and allow the listeners to fill in the gaps the way they wish. It's even more frank than writing "intentional gibberish" lyrics, which end up alienating the listeners. Sigur R&oacute;s here does not alienate anyone; quite the contrary. One may listen to this album after losing a dear person, and giving it that kind of meaning; other may find it the perfect soundtrack to the happiest stage of his life. And so on! Of course, that explanation is what <em>I</em> believe in, and you may have different explanations to the album's nature. See? The album is so open that you may have a completely different idea about it than I do.</p>

<p>But then, you'll realise that, for an album of that kind to <em>work</em>, the music has to be <em>specifically</em> good: deep, evocative, emotional and powerful, vague but not too much. And that's exactly what this music is. The music works wonders with the concept. Stylistically, also, it's very different from [a]&Aacute;g&aelig;tis byrjun[/a]: it's more mantraic and repetitive, and these tracks are less reminiscent of "songs" than [s]Star&aacute;lfur[/s] and [s]Flugufrelsarinn[/s], for example. These eight tracks are more like eight drawn-out musical blurs; "sonic landscpes", if you will, but not very focused and defined (exactly in order to allow different people to have different interpretations of it). But they aren't only repetitive drones: they all have some development, some motion, they <em>go somewhere</em>. They have emotional edge, dynamics, build-ups and climaxes.</p>

<p>According to the band, the album is divided in two "halves" (separated by a 30 second gap of silence): a "happy" half, and a "sad" half. But, at least to me, the entire album is rather sad. But to me, the mood is less important than the beauty. The band finds those simple, but gorgeous little combinations of notes and sounds that sound <em>perfect</em> to the ear. And that is found already in the very first track. You know this one if you've seen the famous video with the kids playing among the black snow under the red sky of the post-apocalyptic world. You might remember that fantastic little piano line that runs through the song. It's so gentle, but so stunningly sad, and yet Kjartan manages to make each note sound more expressive than entire songs by other bands. The song slowly takes shape and builds into a gut-wrenching climax, and then just dies away, slowly. Who needs lyrics when you have such a massive array of expression? Words would do this composition a disservice. Track two brings an even darker mood and a quiet motif played on guitar. There are drums, this time around, played by Orri P&aacute;ll Dyrasson (&Aacute;gust's replacement), repeating a quite simple motif. It's <em>definitely</em> mantraic, but it also has those subtle dynamics, and as it ends, the third song comes in, and then... well, wow. The song's basically nothing but a simple piano loop repeating over a cycle of five chords, but the loop keeps going and going around, and a whole wall of sound begins to emerge and build around you. It's stunning and almost transcendental, and before it reaches a grandiose and Earth-shattering climax, it begins to fade, and dies slowly and gently; a pattern that sounds way too similar to the first track, but the difference in texture and mood more than makes up for it. And it's amazing how heartfelt everything sounds. It's probably the only moment when the album becomes "happy", which then leads into the bright, joyous fourth track, which is the only track here that could be released as a "pop song" of sorts, not only due to the sing-along-y melody, but also for the sparkling guitar lines and faster tempo. It <em>almost</em> sounds at odds with the rest of the album, but the contrast is more than welcome.</p>

<p>But then, after the thirty seconds of silence, the "sad" part of the album begins in a really dark note. The fifth tracks is <em>very</em> slow and <em>very</em> quiet, with humming organ and brushed drums. This one took a long time to crawl under my skin, mostly due to the <em>very</em> static and downplayed intro; yet, eventually, it became one of my favourites &mdash; the construction of the track and the painful, gut-wrenching path towards the tortured climax justifies all its 10 minutes. The sixth track is structurally similar, but shorter, and features a tribal-like percussion pattern and Georg using an E-bow on the bass guitar (fairly unusual, but not as unusual as using a drum stick). It's far more mellow and quiet, and J&oacute;nsi's vocal melody is particularly touching. But the seventh track, the longest here, is very serious and dramatic, and keeps alternating slow, quiet parts with louder, faster moments, but they sound quite painful &mdash; and the moment when J&oacute;nsi is left dueting with the bowed guitar deserves mention.</p>

<p>The album finally reaches the last track, and it's much brighter than anything that popped up in the last thirty minutes. The guitar riff is quite catchy, as is the vocal melody and pretty much everything else. But the song's true face comes when the drums start bashing out an insistent rhythm, and J&oacute;nsi starts to repeat a small bendy melody, building tension with it. And all the instruments start bashing more and more furiously, until it sounds like the entire album is bursting out its tension through a loud, furious climax &mdash; easily the most intense moment of music Sigur R&oacute;s did so far. Definitely amazing.</p>

<p>Of course, "describing" the songs is not an easy job. The album is an actual <em>listening experience</em>, and since the album is so open and vague, it's useless for me to try and "explain" it. But, suffice to say, it's very challenging, intriguing and rewarding. And you must be <em>patient</em> with it. Not only the songs are slow, take time to build, and the transitions are quite draggy, but the album itself isn't a piece of cake. It's not "thrilling", and not as "gratuitous" as its predecessor. You know, compared to this, [a]&Aacute;g&aelig;tis byrjun[/a] is unashamed motherfucking pop sell-out. Of course it <em>isn't</em> motherfucking pop sell-out, and if it were, who the hell cares? I'd listen to it anyway. But what I mean is that you can't expect nonstop thrills and excitement with [a]( )[/a]. You should really let it take you over: listen to it in headphones while lying on bed, on a dark room, or whatever you wish, but <em>be patient</em>. It <em>will</em> be richly rewarding if you treat it the right way. To put it in pretentious terms, this must be one of the most perfect combinations of Ambient and Rock I've ever seen: it's both Ambient music with Rock instrumentation, and Rock with Ambient intentions. Obviously, it's <em>neither</em> Rock nor Ambient, but... you know, it is Sigur R&oacute;s. You must expect those quirky things from them.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
<p>"Takk" means "Thanks". And who is the band saying "thanks" to here? Their fans, I suppose? After releasing an album that they hated, and after apologising with [a]&Aacute;g&aelig;tis byrjun[/a], and after being widely hailed and praised with their subsequent releases, there's nothing more polite and diplomatic than saying thanks to everyone! And I assume that's what the band is doing here, and if I'm right, then they must be really nice guys. I bet that, immediately before they release their mega-experimental quadruple CD, they're going to release an album called "Excuse Me". That wouldn't be such a bad idea, I guess.</p>

<p>And the title track is no more than two minutes of a rising, shimmery synth chord and uplifting atmosphere. Well, indeed, I said "uplifting", so you can be sure this album doesn't have much to do with [a]( )[/a]. The tracks have titles, you know! And they sing in Icelandic in most of these songs! And the album is, well, you know, <em>happy</em>. You wanted to know how does a happy Sigur R&oacute;s sound like? Yeah, kind of like [s]Star&aacute;lfur[/s]. But you can't think of [a]&Aacute;g&aelig;tis byrjun[/a] as a happy album, can you? I can't, at least. Well, [a]Takk...[/a] is quite happy and uplifting, and not in a corny way. I won't speculate and try to tell what motivated the band to make such shiny music. Perhaps they were SELLING OUT to the international market? Or maybe they were trying to tone down their music into something more accessible (note that both questions are exactly the same thing, only varying in tone)? Well, try to imagine what kind of pressure the band was going through: having just released their third LP, the band had the world by their feet. The kind of music they were making was "different", "exotic". Critics and public were in love, dying with anticipation for the next release, but also ready to burn them at the stake at the first sign of repetition, lack of ideas, self-parody and whatever else. Hm... quite an annoying situation.</p>

<p>So, there's always the dilemma: try to do something different, or continue doing what you do best? Both choices have their rewards and their traps, but you might know that already. What happened here is that the band went down the second road. In terms of musical elements, there isn't a lot here that the band hasn't done before: you've still got things like the disimbodied bowed guitar, the meandering horns a la [s]Olsen Olsen[/s], J&oacute;nsi's wails in Hopelandic, the Amina string quartet, and of course, the razing build-ups and climaxes. You can judge that however you wish: you can say the band's starting to recycle their own ideas, or worse, falling into self-parody, <em>or</em> you can say the band's just trying to establish their own, unique style. One judgement is a bit harsh, and the other one is a bit indulgent. So, I just repeat what I said before: the band's doing what they do best. And why run the risk of doing something else and end up with something really worthless and bad?</p>

<p>And we're really jumping to conclusions way too early here: there <em>are</em> a couple of novelties here, like the wandering, waltzy rhythms of [s]S&eacute; lest[/s], or the upbeat (!!) [s]Gong[/s]. They're only novelties within Sigur R&oacute;s's style, of course, but that's the point. The crucial thing is that the big change here isn't in the musical aspect. The true aspect that wins me over in this album is its <em>aura</em>, the atmosphere, the spirit, call it whatever you want. Is it a very subjective thing to talk about? I wouldn't say so. If you really absorbed their previous two releases during those years, you may already have a notion of what Sigur R&oacute;s is "supposed" to be. With that notion in mind, [a]Takk...[/a] will be a real shock. I think the secret to enjoying this album is getting past the lack of musical innovations and absorbing the album's emotional power &mdash; that's why it might take you a couple of listens before you finally understand the album's worth.</p>

<p>And, of course, the album only has emotional power because the music is excellently written and performed, all the way through. You don't need much more than this album to realise the band has actual <em>talent</em>, and didn't only have cheap tricks and gimmicks up their sleeves. It takes <em>skill</em> to come up with music like this. But wait a minute! Is this review so far convincing you that [a]Takk...[/a] is only business as usual and doesn't bring anything new to the table? Because, you know, that's not really true. There <em>are</em> differences. But didn't I say there were little changes in the musical department? Yes, exactly. But there's a difference between changing the music itself, and changing the way in which the music is employed. And so, what's the stylistic change here? In short: the songs got shorter. Yep, that's right. Some songs here are pretty close to "pop" territory, both in structure and in pace. Try hearing [s]Hopp&iacute;polla[/s] and check it out. The musical elements are all there: Kjartan's sweety-sweet piano line, the strings and the horns, J&oacute;nsi's endearing vocals, the subtle harmonies and vocal layering, the simple and stomping drum pattern, and whatever you can name. But Sigur R&oacute;s have <em>never</em> done a four-minute <em>song</em>, have they? Their last four-minute track was [s]Avalon[/s], which was a one-minute segment of music slowed down four times.</p>

<p>So, are they really selling out to pop? In part. I can actually see two trends here &mdash; just like we have [s]Hopp&iacute;polla[/s], we have [s]S&eacute; lest[/s], which is basically what [a]( )[/a] would sound like, Hopelandic and everything, if you took it to an amusement park for a change. There are about two parts in the music, and they're all based on the same little phrases and melodies. But instead of moody organs, slow guitar lines, dramatic strings and whatever else, you have these beautiful glockenspiels, <em>happy</em> strings and a lot more. And when it sounds like nothing new is popping up, these horns come in playing a "fairground" rhythm. If you want to enjoy the song, you'll have to enjoy primarily the atmosphere it creates.</p>

<p>But if you want musical <em>meat</em>, there's still a lot to look out for here. [s]Gl&oacute;s&oacute;li[/s] must be one of the band's finest accomplishments ever. They reach a wonderful combination of glockenspiels, orchestration, gorgeous vocal melody, J&oacute;nsi's strange, whispery vocal intonations, and a steadily stomping rhythm... but wait, it's not "stomping". It doesn't "stomp", it mostly... it <em>chomps</em>. Yeah, it goes "chomp, chomp, chomp", as if the bass drum was sucking air instead of pumping it. There's also one of the greatest uses of J&oacute;nsi's guitar being scraped by his cello bow, producing that hauntingly beautiful growl. And when the pace becomes twice as fast, the pleasant melody becomes almost a cry, and the instruments start to boil and stir, the song doesn't just reach a climax... it erupts, it explodes, it turns into a hellish torrent of fire. I don't know how to put it in words. Suffice to say, there's very little that I hate more than a poor, unnecessary, overly pompous musical climax with little substance &mdash; and [s]Gl&oacute;s&oacute;li[/s] avoids every pitfall with grace and class. It's a magificent display of sound craft.</p>

<p>From track 6 until the end, the album enters a streak of continuous, non-stop beauty &mdash; and surprisingly, this stretch is very... um, what's the opposite of "monotonous"? Say, "polytonous"? Well, be it! There are faster songs, like the almost funky [s]Gong[/s]; not quite a classic, but a real highlight in the album. The first half of [s]S&aelig;gl&oacute;pur[/s] isn't very different, though it's <em>way</em> more tense and gut-wrenching. The band shows a great ability of grabbing your heart and squeezing it until it aches, and this song shows that very well. But instead of erupting into a climax, it does the opposite &mdash; it collapses in exhaustion, and ends with a stunningly, achingly gorgeous passage with piano chords and gentle strings. Man, Kjartan <em>is</em> a solid keyboardist &mdash; he manages to make each piano note, each piano chord speak volumes. And for another example of that, there's [s]M&iacute;lan&oacute;[/s], with one of those unexplainably simple, beautiful piano lines. This one is very mantraic and repetitive, building huge dynamics and turbulences with the same vocal iterations. It's "Happy [a]( )[/a]" all over again! And it's quite a surprise that the 10 minute track in the album isn't a pale copy of [s]Vi&eth;rar vel til loft&aacute;r&aacute;sa[/s], like I initially feared. It's just... great, like everything else here. The Amina string quartet are credited as co-writers of the song, here, and though I don't know how evident their songwriting collaboration is, you can hear their strings all over the song.</p>

<p>The final three tracks end the album in a slow, quiet note. [s]Andvari[/s] is <em>very</em> slow and soothing, with a beautiful arrangement for strings, and a lengthy "pseudo-ambient" ending, with the string chords droning on and on for a while. [s]Svo hlj&oacute;tt[/s] is more intense and louder, with more dynamics and more instruments, too. And when it settles down, it goes calmer and quieter until it turns into the fantabulous [s]Heys&aacute;tan[/s], that ends the album on an understated tone. In fact, it's one of the very few Sigur R&oacute;s songs that I actually <em>wish</em> were longer. But actually, the part that I love the most is the moment when the song begins, on top of the piano reverberations of the previous track. And... isn't it a bit frustrating that "Heys&aacute;tan" doesn't mean what it <em>looks</em> like? It means "Haystack". But it talks about dying &mdash; dying <em>happily</em>, that is.</p>

<p>When I think about it, there <em>are</em> little similarities between this album and [a]&Aacute;g&aelig;tis byrjun[/a] in terms of structure and sound. But that's why you have to appreciate the aura of the album, you know. Sigur R&oacute;s isn't like every other band: I think they gained quite a lot of credibility, so you can use different criteria to judge their work. And with such solid, well-written and gorgeous music, you just <em>can't</em> condemn them for repeating themselves. This is only their <em>fourth</em> LP, right? Many other bands kept the same style of music for dozens of albums, and Sigur R&oacute;s has just finished beginning. If you want to start judging the decisions they are making and the roads they're travelling, you'll have to look at next album... but for now, enjoy [a]Takk...[/a] for all it's worth. It deserves praise, and I know I like it &mdash; so much, in fact, that I'm rating it higher than [a]&Aacute;g&aelig;tis byrjun[/a] &mdash; but not that I'm neglecting its extraordinary power, mind you. But when it comes to [a]Takk...[/a], it's not just its power that is extraordinary.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
<p>So will I have to start talking about Sigur R&oacute;s repeating themselves again? Not that I want to be nasty or anything &mdash; it's just an aspect of the band to be analysed. But I'm actually not too worried about the self-repetition here. What calls my attenion is that I can see a few radical attempts at "rupture" here than on [a]Takk...[/a]. The band comissioned Flood to handle production duties, and in several occasions, the band is aiming towards a more organic, up-close, down-to-Earth sound. What! Sigur R&oacute;s trying to sound <em>un-heavenly</em>? But aren't they supposed to be the angelic sounds of the icecaps and ice covered mountains of icy Iceland?... actually, I think Sigur R&oacute;s couldn't sound "un-heavenly", not even if they tried &mdash; it's way too much into them. But, yes, they're purposefully pulling themselves away from the "distant" sounds of their previous LPs. [a]Takk...[/a] already had a sunny atmosphere, and this album expands on it &mdash; <em>and</em> brings them further down into the ground. To me, honestly, that's a very good thing.</p>

<p>What isn't such a good thing, though, is me listening in advance to the single [s]Gobbledigook[/s] (released as a free digital download), being utterly blown away, thinking "Wow! If the rest of the album follows this path, it's going to be their best ever by far", and realising... the album doesn't follow that path. Disappointment? To be honest, yes. It was pretty anticlimactic to hear the band retreating to [a]Ba Ba Ti Ki Di Do[/a] already on the second track. But you know what? That's what repeated listens are for; and, with time, I came to appreciate the album for what it is. The band isn't desperately trying to "change"; and I far prefer the band trying tiny, isolated ruptures than pulling off an [a]Achtung Baby[/a] and ruining everything. So there. [s]Gobbledigook[/s]? It's <em>great</em>. Orri slams those drums as if his life depended on it, and everywhere the band is creating whirlwinds of off-beat acoustic guitar chords, hyperactive la-la-la-las and a simple yet untrivial vocal melody. It's a prime pop song, far more radically so than [s]Hopp&iacute;polla[/s], and its only fault is in leading you to believe the rest of the album will follow suit. It doesn't, so deal with it.</p>

<p>What comes next, [s]Inn&iacute; m&eacute;r syngur vitleysingur[/s], does make it seem like the band is saying "okay, we've gone too far with those pop shenanigans! We'll go back to being our cute, heavenly selves just like you creepy hardcore fans want", falling back to the tinkling glockenspiels, fast stomping drum pattern and wandering vocal melody &mdash; complete with the horn ensemble at the end. But, heck, you know what? There's an irresistible energy in the way J&oacute;nsi sings that melody and makes it come across so seamlessly, and the finale with the same melody line repeated over and over on top of a mighty crescendo is something the band never got to do; it's like they tried the good ole Sigur R&oacute;s climactic finale, but on a smaller, more lighthearted scale. And it works! The piece as a whole is very familiar, but neatly framed by a friendly pop structure &mdash; kind of like [s]Hopp&iacute;polla[/s], yes. So that means... oh, man, Sigur R&oacute;s are turning POP? But... but where are the lengthy songs? The sprawling soundscapes? The ambient sonic paintings?</p>

<p>Why, they're over there, on [a]( )[/a]! You can go listen to that one, if you wish. It's a great album. Meanwhile this one keeps steadily on the "we're selling out to the mainstream and we DON'T GIVE A DAMN" (man, J&oacute;nsi is turning into the next Justin Timberlake! Sigur R&oacute;s fans: mass suicide!!) path with the disarmingly gorgeous ballad [s]G&oacute;&eth;an daginn[/s]. Yes, they tried an acoustic ballad before with [s]&Aacute;g&aelig;tis byrjun[/s], but this one is shorter, faster, and just as beautiful! Not quite as "aethereal" &mdash; in fact, just listen to the finger scraping against the strings. How much more organic and human can you get? This isn't the work of a band trying to be "aethereal", so there's little point in expecting the song to be like that. I love the song just the way it is, really, and that initial three song stretch is almost worth the price of admission alone.</p>

<p>What comes next doesn't fall below par, but it does become a sort of mixed bag. I didn't say the album was perfect, did I? It's not. I never really cared much about [s]Vi&eth; spilum endalaust[/s], even though in principle I find it cool that the band should combine a harmonium with brasses and guitars and pump it up into a fun, catchy tune. It <em>is</em> catchy, but somehow that melody sounds... fishy. I dunno, it's like I heard it before. I might have even heard it before, in fact, but I can't put my finger on it. The problem with this song is that the band tries a bit too hard to sound joyful and fresh &mdash; they sound joyful and fresh on those three first tracks, and effortlessly so. I think they exaggerate it a little bit here, though not enough to <em>ruin</em> the song; and the melody and arrangement help to neuatralise those flaws quite a bit. Elsewhere you get slightly more "normal", but perfectly beautiful songs, like the piano-laden electro-ballad [s]Me&eth; su&eth; &iacute; eyrum[/s] and the "guitar and voice" ballad [s]Illgresi[/s]; which is actually quite surprising, because who expected a track that sounds like J&oacute;nsi is performing right there, in your living room? The melody is well-crafted, and he delivers it in a very sober, tuneful lower register that evades the "holy spirit of GOD" epithets. If this were a Coldplay song written and recorded by Chris Martin and placed on [a]X&amp;Y[/a], it'd probably be quite unremarkable; recorded by Sigur R&oacute;s and placed <em>here</em>, it's worthy of mention. Sorry, Coldplay. But I'm not lambasting your acoustic guitar ballads. [s]Green Eyes[/s] is still wonderful.</p>

<p>What DID severely get on my nerves the first few times I listened to the album was goddamn [s]Festival[/s]. Why the heck would I be pissed off by goddamn [s]Festival[/s]? Why, because goddamn [s]Festival[/s] is nothing but [s]Gl&oacute;s&oacute;li[/s], [s]Hafs&oacute;l[/s] and the final track of [a]( )[/a] all rolled into one!! Yeah, what's with that Georg Holm's scraping D major bass riff that kicks in with the pumping bass drum? That's one tiny step away from the "bass played with drumsticks" intro of [s]Hafs&oacute;l[/s]! And the slow build-up with "running" drums and slow crescendo of voices and strings? [a]( )[/a] finale! And the final, glorious finale with strings and guitars? [s]Gl&oacute;s&oacute;li[/s]! That was a disappointment to me, because it sounded like the band was just going back to safe, familiar ground in order to satisfy long term fans. But what I failed to recognise is that the "intro" of the song, with J&oacute;nsiman singing nearly a capella over soft, hushed synth pad backgrounds, is not an "intro": it's the main part of the song! When did we get J&oacute;n &THORN;or singing on his own like that?? We didn't! True, the melody sounds like an reject from the [a]( )[/a] sessions (and it's all sung in Hopelandic as well), but... man! With that in mind, I was able to see the instrumental conclusion as a necessary, crucial component of the song, a conclusive finale. Okay, so this is nowhere as beautiful as [s]M&iacute;lan&oacute;[/s], for example (and Amiina aren't playing on the album &mdash; a shame), but it's still a song worth existing. As for particularly good points, I have to single out [s]&Aacute;ra b&aacute;tur[/s] as my favourite on the record. Okay, so the song really wanders around softly as a voice + piano ballad for about half of its nine minutes, while the London Symphonietta and the boys' choir of some British school whose name I don't remember just stand there, doing nothing; and by the end, you just get the good ole J&oacute;nsi falsetto in Hopelandic with the grandiose finale, at last, when the whole audience is already sound asleep. Well... at least that's what Pitchforkmedia wants you to believe. I, personally, love the song &mdash; duh! I mentioned it as a high point, didn't I? And why? Because I, unlike the Pitchforkmedia reviewer, care about melody; and the song is magnificent, melodywise, and I don't care if half of the song is made up of piano and voice only, and that the London Symphonietta and the choir of the London Oratory School only come up at the end. Who cares? It's a BALLAD, made of melodies and verses, and the final climactic finale feel like an absolutely unnecessary, inevitable, gut-wrenching emotional climax to the whole ride. And that melody they're playing? It's fantastic! And better: the climax is far more understated than it <em>could</em> have been if the band were on "END OF THE WORLD" mode. And the whole thing was recorded entirely live on the studio? Impressive. [s]Flj&oacute;tavik[/s], after the whole album has become quiet with [s]Illgresi[/s], comes in like... well, I don't remember a song in Sigur R&oacute;s's catalogue sounding so plaintive and longing on its <em>very first notes</em>. Only the first track of [a]( )[/a] comes to mind, and that was the album opener; [s]Flj&oacute;tavik[/s] comes in after a rather varied, "tiresome" journey. It's not exactly "soothing" &mdash; it's more depressing than "soothing", in fact, and the whole delivery &mdash; from J&oacute;nsi's understated singing, the soft piano playing, the occasional Mellotron are damn near undescribable. And on the final verse, out of nothing, WHOOSH, J&oacute;nsi is in falsetto and the whole song takes off &mdash; and they're not even destroying the Earth with their guitars and drums. Really, guys, I don't recall a Sigur R&oacute;s song achieving this level of emotional response in me. And its sudden, unexpected ending leaves you off to a "recap" of the song's melody done ambient style, on [s]Straumnes[/s].</p>

<p>Keep in mind that, first time I heard the album, I had no idea what to expect from the songs &mdash; but I did know that [s]All Alright[/s] was the first Sigur R&oacute;s song in English, and that it was a six minute long album closer. What did I expect? Why, of course: an Earth-shattering, radio-friendly "raise your arms and swing your lighters" single for the American audiences tired of Chris Martin moaning "and IIII will tryyyyyy to fix you". And why did I get?... ... ... a piano ballad. And I mean a "piano ballad" as in "Kjartan plays two notes and J&oacute;nsi sings three notes, repeat the process every two hours". THAT is the First Sigur R&oacute;s Song In English? Well, yes &mdash; and I tell you, if I hadn't been informed the song was in English, I would have never guessed. Bj&ouml;rk sings with a thick accent, especially on her first records, but not only J&oacute;nsi's accent is way, way thicker, he sings so quietly and slowly that it's <em>really</em> hard to hear the words until you're listening closely. And yeah, so the lyrics go on about wanting "him" to know what he has done, which "is bad", and "now he'll know what I am telling". You may need a repeated listen to realise how nicely crafted and pretty the melody is, because there IS a melody; it's just slow and quiet. But... that's just the first half of the song. The second half is the same melody, but J&oacute;n goes up an octave and is joined by a quiet horn ensemble. I know I'll sound corny, but by my third or fourth listen, this song strained me emotionally in a way I had formally <em>never</em> experienced with music before. The more cynical dudes will hear the song as pure syrup, but you just need to realise that the artist isn't ALWAYS going for easy emotional appeal when he goes up an octave and brings in a brass ensemble. If it were Bono doing this, it wouldn't have worked. If it were Thom Yorke... wait, Thom Yorke would turn this into a dirge, wouldn't he? If it were Wayne Coyne... wait, he'd be singing about Yoshimi, right? Yeah, definitely, only J&oacute;n &THORN;or could have pulled that one off. Maybe not <em>only him</em>, but he has the chops to pull of a song that's strongly emotional, yet leaving its "message" vague enough so that it can mean many different things. I like that: the artist doesn't bother with the backstory, with the details, the explanation and contextualisation and so on, but simply nails the essence of the emotion with perfection.</p>

<p>I'm really quite glad that [s]All Alright[/s] is there, at the tail end of the album, because it leaves a reassuring taste after the album slows down into pseudo-new-ageville. It gives the album a sense of purpose and a natural conclusion of sorts. And really, if you're open to changes and new, exciting twists, and you don't expect Sigur R&oacute;s to be exactly the same 'till the LHC destroys the world, you'll like this album. Of course, don't trust me blindly: you may find it a boring mix of fake sunshine pop schlock and oversentimental new age muck, or think that in fact the band's too scared to break the formula and evolve for good. If you're afraid, get the best few tracks off iTunes &mdash; i.e. the first three ones, maybe [s]All Alright[/s], maybe [s]&Aacute;ra b&aacute;tur[/s] if you're brave and maybe [s]Festival[/s] if you're a crazy [a]&Aacute;g&aelig;tis byrjun[/a] maniac. But if you generally agree with my reviews so far, grab this album and enjoy. It may take a few listens, but I doubt you'll be sorely disappointed.</p>]]></review>
