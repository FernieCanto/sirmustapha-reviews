<p>It might be just me, but I consider Jean Michel Jarre as one of the most hideously underrated musicians in our history. Call me crazy or not, but that's just what I feel. Of course there are many underrated artists everywhere, but I'm unable to comprehend how Jarre's importance is neglected. Whenever the word "electronica" is mentioned, many things may come to our head. We may remember the techno acts of the 90's, like Autechre; we might remember the epic compositions of Vangelis in the 70's; we can remember Brian Eno's ambient experiments in the 80's; we can think of Tangerine Dream, we can think of Kraftwerk, we can think of Hawkwind... But why, oh why can't we think of Jarre? What exactly went wrong in the history of music to cause this?</p>

<p>Perhaps it's the misconception of the word "electronica". Many people tend to associate it with Kraut rock (Kraftwerk, Amon Düül II, etc.), ambient (Brian Eno, Harold Budd), new age (Vangelis, uh, Mike Oldfield - kidding!), techno (Autechre), Space Rock (Hawkwind, Tangerine Dream) and many other things that make "electronica" a very broad and vain definition. If we take the word "electronica" as an actual genre, that defines simply music made with synths, it's my belief that the absolute pioneer in the genre is nobody other than Jean Michel Jarre. The bands that I mentioned before were focused mostly in sonic experimentation, you know. Brian Eno was making <strong>Another Green World</strong>, that doesn't even approach electronica. Kraftwerk had their Kraut Rock beepity bopity beats. Tangerine Dream had their "spaced out" art rock. But in 1976, Jarre gathered his synths and his Mellotrons and his stuff and made <em>music</em>: with that, <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong> was born. You know, <em>music</em>. <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong> might be a very experimental album, but still, it's more focused in music rather than sonic exploration. Even if the other bands had already "discovered" synth music, Jarre was the first one to go there and create something <em>palpable</em> and potentially accessible out of it.</p>

<p>The importance of <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong> by its time of release was immeasurable at its time, and even now it's an impressive work. But my theories are actually confirmed with the 1978 masterpiece <strong>Equinoxe</strong>, that once for all, proves that Jarre was a <em>melody writer</em> that used his synths merely to produce the music, not to create some weirdarse effects. That's more or less what Vangelis was doing at that time, and that's why they're so close together - even if Vangelis seems to overshadow Jarre sometimes. Why Mike Oldfield is also associated with these gentlemen, I don't have a clue on.</p>

<p>Many people try to "categorise" Jarre: Prog rock, Space rock, electronica, techno (!), ambient... but he doesn't fit categories. At least not with <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong> and <strong>Equinoxe</strong>. And to make matters worse, Jarre released <strong>Les Chants Magn&egrave;tiques</strong>, that completely <em>destroys</em> any kind of category that could be given to him. He was criticised at that time, and I really believe that critics suck. Jarre was poking fun at them with the album, and he succeeded. The album is absolutely great, and a worthy inclusion in his catalogue.</p>

<p>Now, no matter how much the "electronica" artists in general are kinda underrated, I still think people are unfair with Jarre. The man made great music, and he did revolutionise music with his works. Now, enough ranting, and let's try to get down to the actual albums, okay?</p>

<p class="guide">
  The Hitchhiker's Guide To Jean Michel Jarre:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Best album for starters: <strong>Equinoxe</strong> - Some may disagree with me, but if you don't like this album, you'd better give up.</li>
  <li>Essential album: <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong> - Mostly because of its importance, but also because of the way it presents Jarre's best qualities in a very interesting way. You MUST have this one.</li>
  <li>Best album: <strong>Equinoxe</strong> - Heh, I have no words here.</li>
  <li>Worst album: <strong>Sessions 2000</strong> - I really don't get the point of this album. You may get it, but I don't. Sorry.</li>
  <li>Best compilation: <strong>Images</strong> - I suppose. Though <strong>AERO</strong> is more interesting for featuring <em>re-recordings</em> of Jarre's classics. And for a live album, get <strong>The Concerts In China</strong>.</li>

<p>Hey man, this is about the reviews you put on for Jarre's albums. I am a big Jarre fan and was fascinated by reading your reviews.. I had searched a lot for some insightful review for Jarre and there aren't many...</p>

<p>I am a person who comes from middle east to west and i have listened to all types of music, but let me tell you Jean michel Jarre maybe underrated in north america, but trust me man he is not underrated in east. There are millions of Fans...in middle east and china he is praised..</p>

<p>something interesting about me is that when I was growing up i would hear music like Equinoxe part 5, oxygene part 2, Equinoxe 4,3, magnetic fields and all those in TV on different progs, and i always had a u see Jarre's music hasthing for them. yo an upper level of understanding of science. for example i remember in our TV we had educational programs like teaching physics and in those programs they would put his music, his  there was a political program about war and on the intro they would put the song Arpegiator which is an absolutely unparalleled piece of electronic . that's why to me whenever i hear magnetic fields part 1, I get even more fascination than anybody else. It is marvelous music.. I have heard all kinds of electronic ( like tangerin dream, vangelis ..) but this is superior music. Jarre has a big sense of humor and I think we see that in his music too.</p>

<p>Jarre's concerts are amazing, he has  the record of 3.5 million spectators in his moscow's concert, or 2 million spectator's in his paris concert. Jarre's crew in millennium concert was 1000 people in front of  20 million spectators. He is a big shot. He eats dinner frequently with Shirak ( president of france).</p>

<p>Anyhow back to your reviews, i think you and I share the same views towards his albums except for <strong>Oxygene 7-13</strong>. before I get into that let me tell you how much i agree with you about <strong>Equinox</strong> specially part 3 which is the only electronic waltz i know of and of course part 5 which is genius; It is a masterpiece of art of Electronic like Godfather is a masterpiece in movies and Beethoven's 5th symphony is a masterpiece. Now back to <strong>Oxygene 7-13</strong>, I think this album has been enormously underrated, I urge you to listen to this album again with a very good sound system ( preferably 7.1 speakers) and look at it through another perspective, the perspective of science of physics and which is the  space time. try to picture space and time interacting, try to feel the oxygen in part 7, the enthusiasm of part 8 (most amazing piece Jarre has engineered in his lifetime) I think you know how many remixes of part 8 there are.. I myself have tried for months to recreate part Oxygene part 8 but i can never make it like the original.. It is too rhythmic too live too professional music. Most my friends have know idea who Jeam michel is and they all listen to hip hop and trance and all that crap but when they heard part 8 they were amazed by this type of music. I had a friend who was a professional musician and didn't know Jarre when i sent him part 8 he said "oh, my ears!!"</p>

<p>part 9 is of course a flashback to <strong>Oxygene</strong> original and part 10 has a genius and catchy melody which has been remixed and technoed by many Dj's Its amazing but i think Jarre is the only person who can play teremin ( the instrument that plays with wind ) that professionally. part 11 is a perfect set up  for part 12 which the most ingenious piece of this album, Part 12 is the true interaction of time and space. part 12 must the hardest thing Jarre has ever done, one of those pieces no body else can engineer in the world and amazing thing is that he used his old 70's instruments to create this part and the rest of the album of course. In general this album sounds very futuristic, something very artificial and yet beautiful. I think if anybody thinks Jarre released this album to cash-in they have not a shred of knowledge of this artist. why would he need to cash-in when he had already sold over 55 million records worldwide??! <span class="edNote">[Editor's note: In fact, you're quite right about <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne 7-13</strong>. It's, by no means, a bad album, and it's actually good! The most interesting thing is that it uses those familiar techno beats, but it doesn't even approach generic Techno (beat that, Mike Wossisface). Very competent and talented musicmaking on that album, it's probably better than I once thought it was.]</span></p>

<p>another thing i wanted to bring into your attention was the Music of Kitaro, I cant describe kitaros's music in words I strongly recommend to get familiar to his music, YOU MUST NOW GO AND GET KITARO'S ALBUM CALLED " <strong>SILK ROAD</strong>"</p>

<p>your soul can fly by kitaros music. the most moving song I have heard in my life is " flying celestial nymphs" from the silk road albums. again i cant describe in words or emotions in that matter. <span class="edNote">[editor's note: I'll keep that in mind! I have seen about that guy before, and if his music is as good as you say it is, I will definitely check it out someday. Thanks!]</span></p>

<p>anyways man, write me when you get the time and i am looking for more insightful review from you. Maybe you could write reviews for Kitaro's <strong>silk road</strong> which is a necessity for your site.</p>

<p>While this isn't Jarre's debut, it's his breakthrough LP, and certainly one of the most groundbreaking and influential electronica albums of its time. I'm not very confident in calling it "innovative", but Jarre managed to avoid making a pale copy of Tangerine Dream or Vangelis and found a small space of his own. And I highly recommend this album for those who seek for an "ambient" piece of music, but who don't identify with Tangerine Dream's spaced-out atmospheres devoid of melodies, neither with Vangelis's Prog Rock leanings.</p>

<p><strong>Oxyg&eacute;ne</strong> is more or less in between "proto-ambient" and Prog Rock, but it isn't either. It can't really be considered "ambient", like Tangerine Dream: there are dynamics, there is development, and the melodic content is too solid. And it ain't Prog Rock, either: it's too slow, airy, and simple in terms of composition. So, what IS it? It's entirely instrumental and done completely with synthesizers, rhythm boxes, keyboards, Mellotrons and such gadgets. It's a single composition, divided in six parts (three in each side of the LP). It's atmospheric and melodic as hell, that it is. And if you doubt Jarre's <em>songwriting</em> skills, listen to the fourth part and you'll be proven wrong. 'Oxyg&egrave;ne 4' manages to fit into the album flawlessly, and still be a hell of a single, with an immediately striking melody and a boppy rhythm. It says all it has to say in four minutes, and keeps up with the airy, windy, floating, cold (in a good way) atmosphere of the rest of the album album.</p>

<p>If it's atmosphere that you want, though, you don't need to look further than the two first parts. The first one starts off quite graceful, with small, fast gushes of windy synthesizer notes, which takes the shape of a minor key mood piece. But like I said, the melodic content of the album is very solid, so the song actually moves through slow, minor-key melodies as it goes, bursting into something of a climax halfway through. But it's only setting up the mood of the album, with the whishy, whooey synthesizer tones. Part two stablishes a beat, and builds a series of cool, half-improvisational keyboard passages over it. It sure gains speed and rhythm, but it's every bit as airy as it was before.</p>

<p>The atmosphere is broken in two moments: Part three is the sound of a storm arriving, with a slow, plodding rhythm and a menacing synth riff keeping everything in place. I like how it isn't "raging", after all, it's just your everyday storm in the forest. Yeah, well, "forest" because of the sounds of birds chirping at the end. Strangely enough, part four reminds me of something far icier, like the South Pole, or something. Part five... doesn't remind me of anything, really. It's the longest song here, and it's divided in two parts: the first one is graceful and cute, with instruments slowly joining in to play a long, slow melody. At the end, there's this deep, booming bass, and the rhythm kicks in again - but this time it's fast, but not plodding. And on top of that, Jarre improvises a series of keyboard solos. It might go on for too long, depending on your tastes. For me, it's alright, though.</p>

<p>The sixth part continues the trend of the first two tracks, with synthesizer chords slowly moving through a minor key melody. What gets my attention is the complete lack of any bass sounds, and the Latin beat underpinning it. The combination produces a strange, but beautiful effect. And don't forget the huge, deep breathing sounds, either. Imagine it as Mother Nature breathing, and the concept of the album makes a lot of sense. It's quite a cool image, anyway. It's not too difficult to see why many people consider this as Jarre's finest hour. I'm not one of those people, though: especially when compared to Jarre's latter output, this is kinda rudimentary and rough, and not too melodically rich. But then again, the "roughness" might be one of the album's greatest strengths, just like with Mike Oldfield's <strong>Tubular Bells</strong>. So there. Fact is, if you're building an electronica collection, this album <em>must</em> be present, want it or not. It's essential and groundbreaking, so get it anyway.</p>

<p>Jarre's second offering isn't a whole lot different from <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong>, as far as sound and production and style are concerned. There's a bigger budget, this time around, which explains the more polished sounds and textures. But budget isn't everything! Fact is, Jarre has improved and sharpened his composing skills a whole lot. And what do you get when you spice up the <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong> formula with better melodies, better textures and better dynamics? Well, you get a masterpiece! And that's exactly what <strong>Equinoxe</strong> is. While it's far less innovative than its older brother, it's definitely an improvement.</p>

<p>See, the album stands less on the "ambient" side, with less meandering synth chords and solos and more coherent structures and more dynamics. Each part is something of a composition in itself, but they form a bigger whole when taken together - as a result, the album is a real journey through oceans, seas and waters. Well... at least, the album does give a very watery feeling - it always did. But I suppose the <em>actual</em> concept of the album is to create the passage of a full equinox, from sunrise to the next morning, perhaps? Well, part one <em>definitely</em> feels like a sunrise. And what a sunrise it is! The song is mainly based on a single, very simple descending riff, and it's simply stunning. It soars higher and higher with every chord change, and eventually it falls back slowly to Earth, and the stage is set.</p>

<p>Part two is basically a transitional piece, not too different from the airy passages of 'Oxyg&egrave;ne 1', but with those bubbly sounds and sweeping chords like waves, instead of gushes of winds. But judging by it, you can hardly tell what's coming up! Part three kicks in with a waltz rhythm, and that looping riff and the twisty main melody are easily some of the most treasurable things in Jarre's entire catalogue. It's obviously one of the best things in the album, and the lengthy, atmospheric coda makes justice to the brilliant music here. Part four is the first song with a bouncy rhythm (you've got lots of those on side B), and more of those unexplainably simple and fantastic melodies. As usual, you have the strategic and clever sound effects, as if there wasn't enough atmosphere in the music already. It just doesn't stop getting better.</p>

<p>Side B is a bit more static, with most of it taken over by a single boppy, bouncy rhythm. But don't be disappointed, for part five is pretty much what 'Oxyg&egrave;ne 4' was on the previous album. And it's even better. That is, much, <em>much</em> better. So good, in fact, it's one of my favourite pieces of music <em>ever</em>. Honestly. I never managed to find another piece of music that creates such amount of tension in its gradual, understated introduction until that atom-splittingly fantastic melody comes up. If this song doesn't convince you of Jarre's melody-writing skills, then you're just crazy. This is one of the best tracks he ever did, up there with 'Fourth Rendez-Vous'. I just can't laud this song enough - I could spend paragraphs raving over it, and I still wouldn't make it justice.</p>

<p>The music settles down with the transitional sixth part, which slowly "drowns" the rhythm with its sound effects and blooping synth notes. And part seven is just another of those fantastic Jarre melodies, which begins deep below the water and slowly surfaces, until it begins to soar, and falls back again with another atmospheric coda. The final part kind of keeps up with the tradition of ending the album with a small "joke": this time around, it's a little tune with a French flavour, which was called 'Band In The Rain' for his live record <strong>The Concerts In China</strong>. But it only lasts for a minute, and gives way to a slow, soaring reprise of the gorgeous melody of part five. It's morning again, the sun's about to rise, though the equinox is over.</p>

<p>It's hard to talk about this album without getting poetic and metaphoric. See, this is one of the very few albums that <em>truly</em> take me to another world. And I'm sure that it's not just the atmosphere, the textures or the synth sounds - if the <em>music</em> wasn't so great, it wouldn't work. And you can show me any electronic album in your collection of Tangerine Dream and Vangelis, and I'll insist that <em>this</em> is one of the greatest achievements of synthesizer music ever. Jarre managed to make an entirely synthetic album and make it emotionally resonant and <em>palpable</em>. It may be abstract at times, but it gets a grip of my soul and <em>never</em> lets go. And what's most amzing is that I never get the feeling that it's just an electronic, synthetic creation: everything is very clear and very real in my head. And how does Jarre achieve that? With melodies, I tell you. It's all about the melodies. Can you imagine this album without part five or four? I know <em>I</em> can't.</p>

<p>Hi Fernie !</p>

<p>I'm sorry that I have to destroy the pictures in your mind, but equinox is NOT the longest day of the year. If you look it up, you'll find out that we have equinox when day and night have the same length (the origin of this word is surely  'equal'). So there is one equinox at the beginning of spring and another equinox at the beginning of autumn. The first side of the LP has a sunny and warm atmosphere, the second sounds cool and rainy. Any suggestions ?</p>

<p><span class="edNote">[editor's note: Yes, yes, I did commit that mistake. I messed up the equinox with the solstice, but thanks to J&ouml;rg, I stand corrected, and no, he did not destroy the pictures in my mind. In fact, the album makes a bit more of sense now!]</span></p>

<p><strong>Oxyg&egrave;</strong> and <strong>Equinoxe</strong> might not be the same album, but they <em>do</em> sound alike, let's face it. They are pretty much grounded on the same ideals. And apparently, to Jarre, two albums sounding alike was already too much. So, he took the most logical step and changed - and puzzled most of the critics, too. After all, his two previous albums were really easy to be compared with Tangerine Dream, and whatever other "space rock" band you can think of. But when Jarre puts out such a rhythmic, organic album, what do you compare it with? Exactly - you don't compare it. You call it mortal and mundane.</p>

<p>And, of course, time has proven those critics wrong. What you've got here is simply another masterpiece, and a proof that Jarre had much more under his sleeve to show the world. He cast aside the abstract, otherworldly landscapes and chose to do something much more Earthly, indeed, filled with electric, frenzied rhythms, hysterical, bopping synthesizers and, of course, the God-like melodies he could do so well. And when I talk about frenzied rhythms, I'm not talking about the boppity-boppity-bop of 'Equinoxe 5' and such - this is wild, European samba! Really! And when the rhythm isn't taking over, you get all sorts of Pink Floyd-ish sonic landscapes and noises. Want to check all that stuff out? Just listen to the first part. After all, it occupies the entire first side. Yes! A seventeen minute composition it is, but interestingly, it <em>is</em> more or less divided in three "movements". Jarre would expand that style further on <strong>Rendez-Vous</strong>, but for now, you'll have to take this track as a sort of "standalone" composition which <em>still</em> manages to be a crucial part of the album, as well as every other track.</p>

<p>The song kicks off with the rhythm in full force, already - a big tapestry of crazy synthesizers running and jumping all over the place. It does <em>indeed</em> sound magnetic... you'll just have to hear it yourself to understand. It's, by far, one of the coolest things he ever did. And the fun comes back at the end, with an even faster rhythm, and an awesome melody on top of it all. But... what comes <em>in between</em> those parts? Well, you have this eerie, scary and gorgeous crescendo of growling synthesizers, samples of speech and sounds of planes and whatever you can think of. It's useless for me to try to explain it - it's a piece that defies explanations. One of the finest pieces of electronic music, easily.</p>

<p>Side two doesn't quite match the brilliance of side one, but that's no mean feat - besides, it does have another Earth-shatteringly brilliant Jarre "pop song" for the world to see - the melody is simple yet infectious, and the rhythm is restless. It's hard to tell what's the best thing about the song, really! I usually don't love songs because of their rhythms, but Jarre's work with his synthesized percussion here is quite brilliant. Part four takes it easy on the rhythms, but the melody is just beautiful. For some reason, it seems to point a finger towards 'Fourth Rendez-Vous', but whatever.</p>

<p>Only third part doesn't really achieve much... It's "sonic exploration," I guess, with musical-box-like notes stumbling all over the place, and some meandering synth solos over it. It's nothing bad, but it only works as what it is: a musical link. And part five takes the "musical joke" thing one step further: it's a full-blown rumba piece. It works as a funny, "nonsense" closer to the album, but not much more. But then again, how else should this album be finished? It's pretty odd and unpredictable, and that's the whole point. The biggest strength of the album, though, is that it just doesn't try to get away with being "weird" and "cute". It's a solid, beautiful piece of music, and one of Jarre's most interesting and curious works - and more interesting and curious than the albums he made when he was <em>trying</em> to be interesting and curious, oddly enough...</p>

<p>Maybe Jarre was afraid of becoming formulaic, or he just wanted a helluva fun, because this album sounds <em>completely</em> different from his previous efforts. And I'm not talking just about change of sound: I'm talking about everything. The most obvious feature is that this album is <em>song oriented</em>! What happened to the artsy conceptual composer? Sell-out? Nope, not at all. There is a bit of pop composition in the album, but it still is entirely instrumental and "artsy". The big thing is, Jarre doesn't form a synthetic ensemble like in his previous albums. Most songs here use almost rock instrumentation (alas synthesized), and I hear Adrian Belew plays guitar in the album - I can't confirm this, though. The production is closer to 80's Synth Pop than to Prog Rock. There are drum machines, doodle-doodling bass, synth melodies and... samples. <em>Lots</em> of samples. In fact, the album could be held as a display of Jarre's experimentations with samples. They're used in various ways - as rhythm sections, as melodic components, as pure embellishments, etc. Not that there are <em>millions</em> of samples <em>everywhere</em>: The focus of the album isn't to shove these sounds down your throat. They're used cleverly, but that's it.</p>

<p>There are only two songs here that exceed 7 minutes - and they're on side one. 'Ethnicolor I' sets up the mood, with a slow, droney intro, embellished with those vocal samples, sounds and a female "tut tut" voice playing an actual melody (!). You <em>will</em> recognise these sounds as the ones used in <strong>Les Chants Magn&egrave;tiques</strong> and <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong>, but the mood is different. This slow passage goes through a number of small climaxes, and then halfway into the track, some very weird vocal samples come in forming a rhythm (!!), that's slowly joined by drum machines, synths, and it takes off into a cool, funky jam propelled by synths and all sorts of cool stuff. It's easily one of the album's strongest spots, showing both the use of samples and the vintage Jarre melodicism. The next song, 'Diva', follows exactly the same pattern, but it's vastly inferior. It just doesn't sound so "epic," it's not really memorable, and we have to cope with the "Diva" moaning and cooing everywhere. It's good, but can be extremely grating and annoying for some.</p>

<p>Fortunately, side two kicks in with a <em>superb</em> three-song-stretch that's more than enough reason for you to get this record. The title track is an infinitely brilliant pop tune driven by vocal samples (even weirder than on 'Ethnicolor I') and a catchy-as-shit synth melody. 'Wooloomooloo' is an alarmingly creepy droney pseudo-ambient song. Yeah, creepy! Wait until you hear it. And finally, 'Zoolookologie' is the weirdest in the album, with an extremely funky rhythm, more twisted sounds and a "tut tut" driven melody. How infinitely cool.</p>

<p>The album loses steam towards the end, though. 'Blah Blah Cafe' is totally annoying, because while you expect <em>lots</em> of vocal samples, there are <em>none</em>. The "dialoguing" synth tones, while funny on the first listen, aren't as appealing on future listens. And 'Ethnicolor II', while not weak, is a slow, droney and repetitive pseudo-ambient song that's nowhere are creepy as 'Wooloomooloo'. I don't know if I'm missing the point with these two songs, or if they're <em>really</em> the weakest of the lot. Maybe other people love it, and shun 'Zoolookologie'? Whatever. This album is not exactly <em>patchy</em>, but it shows that Jarre isn't as good in writing "songs" as he was in writing album-long compositions. The album is just a bit inconsistent, and shows both the strengths and flaws in our favourite Synth Wizard. Fortunately, the strengths easily outshine the flaws, and the album is more than good. Plus, it has those cool songs that no Jarre fan can live without.</p>

<p>What's the best way to celebrate a space shuttle launch? Why, make an epic conceptual album about it, of course! Why do you think there are so many crappy epic conceptual albums everywhere?</p>

<p>But that's not the case here. <strong>Rendez-Vous</strong> is <em>anything</em> but crappy. You see, the album was being made for the occasion of the launch of the Challenger space shuttle. But as history has it, the ship sadly exploded a few minutes after the launch, killing all its passengers. The thing is, the album was being made <em>before</em> the incident, and was finished after it. As a result, the album is neither "happy happy celebration" nor "tragic tragic requiem". It has both of these elements, but never abuses the "emotional impact". In fact, the album almost has <em>nothing</em> to do with space motifs. It goes into a more epic, symphonic approach. Doubt it?</p>

<p>The best example is the 'Second Rendez-Vous', which is 10 minutes long, and features lots of string-imitating synths playing just like an orchestra. It's also subdivided into three or four parts, more or less similar, and more or less different from each other. What is the <em>meaning</em> of this, I don't really know. What I know is, it's <em>good</em>! Jarre never goes overboard with his 10+ synth machines, and actually focuses in making this big meaningless thing actually enjoyable. It's <em>completely</em> different from what he has done so far, too. Where are the atmospheres? Where are the samples? <em>Nowhere</em>. While some Jarre fans might miss the things that made Jarre <em>Jarre</em>, this album presents lots of great stuff. Along with the second track, the first side of the album is very tragic and sad - but we still didn't even reach the actual spaceship yet. This feels like we're passing through the history of mankind, or something like that. The 'First Rendez-Vous' features a very dark mood, and some tinkly synths carrying an actually beautiful melody, but the 'Third Rendez-Vous' is truly dark and pessimistic, never losing its "symphonic" approach.</p>

<p>Well, so far... What's <em>really</em> good about this stuff? It's good, but nothing more! Okay, so it is surprising that Jarre is making music <em>like that</em>, but what's <em>SO</em> great about the album?... Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have just reached exactly what is <em>SO</em> great about the album. Yes, I'm talking about the 'Fourth Rendez-Vous', that's not just <em>SO</em> great: it's absolutely one of the greatest, most fantastic moments in Jarre's music ever. Yes, it ranks up there with 'Equinoxe 5', and in certain aspects (<em>certain</em> aspects, not <em>all</em> aspects!), it even <em>tops</em> 'Equinoxe 5'. It's just that the melody is absolutely genial and powerful, and the way the drum machines and the humming and tinkling synths carry the melody is definitely something that makes me proud. It <em>never</em> becomes overblown. I'm serious. This is an absolutely essential and memorable song, and it's no wonder so many people identify it as <em>the quintessential Jarre track</em>. In a way, it actually is. The melody is 100% Jarre, and the arrangements are absolutely masterful. <em>This</em> song is enough to make me give the album, at least, a 10.</p>

<p>The 'Fifth Rendez-Vous' brings back the "symphonic" approach, but here, he's actually narrating the spaceship launch. The first part of the suite begins tenderly, but tense, with a "waltzing" synth line. And then, all those sonic collages come in and out, in and out, and we're left with those synths bleeping and blooping at full speed, and some ominous low-pitch humming lines. Woohoo, we're in space! The track is truly great, indeed, and all parts shine in some way. And then, we're left with the 'Sixth Rendez-Vous', the definitive moment of the album... Originally, it was probably meant to represent the emptiness of space, and the saxophone would be recorded by one of the astronauts inside the ship in outer space, being the first piece of music ever recorded in space... But as it is, it gains a whole new meaning. Strange and alarming.</p>

<p>The whole album is kinda strange, if you ask me. But it is still enjoyable. It won't be a pleasant ride, like <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong> and <strong>Equinoxe</strong>, nor it will be chock full of weirdness, like <strong>Les Chants Magn&egrave;tiques</strong> and <strong>Zoolook</strong>. It's a work of its own, and if it's a masterpiece or not, it all depends in you. To me, this is a great album, a fine addition in Jarre's catalogue, like all others were. It's superior to <strong>Zoolook</strong>, mostly because it's more "accomplished". Of course, for such an important event, how couldn't it be well accomplished? A commendable effort. Get the album, if only for the 'Fourth Rendez-Vous', if you don't feel like getting any compilations.</p>

<p>An ominous sign: Jarre starts repeating himself. For the first time in his career, Jarre releases an album that adds virtually <em>nothing</em> new to his legacy. But, well, the least cynical reviewer in the world (me) would admit that it was just a matter of time before that happened. And it's actually kinda nice to see that he only stopped "progressing" in the late 80's - Mike Oldfield's <strong>Five Miles Out</strong> was released as early as 1982, 9 years after his <strong>Tubular Bells</strong> debut. And seeing as <strong>Revolutions</strong> comes 12 years after <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong>, Jarre kinda wins the "competition" with Mike here. "Competition." Did you know Mike thinks Jarre is crap, and says <strong>Tubular Bells II</strong> is more humane than his work? Of course, we're talking about the post-1992 Mike Oldfield here, which is a different matter.</p>

<p>Anyway, Jarre. <strong>Revolutions</strong>. This album isn't bad. I actually have kinda mixed feelings on which rating to give it. When I go track by track through the album, I get disappointed because this material is so relatively weak, and want to give it, I dunno, a 9. But then, I realise that I actually enjoy the record, if only a little bit, and want to give it a 11. In the end, I think I should stick to a 10. It isn't bad, really. It's just really insubstantial when compared to Jarre's earlier work. It's good, and at least, sounds like actual Jean Michel Jarre. But...</p>

<p>Well, but. The album seems to be a conceptual one. Maybe it's supposed to be a wondering about all the revolutions our society has passed through, and the two "centrepieces" of the album seem to make it clear: the 16-minute "suite" 'Industrial Revolution' doesn't sound exactly "industrial", nor particularily "revolutionary." But I guess this wasn't the intention. Thing is, it's not very good. It's too... standard. Jarre falls into self-repetition, and his style becomes almost a clich&eacute;. Musicwise, it goes back to the <strong>Zoolook</strong> age: samples, sounds, drum-machines, and a more "Prog Rock" arrangement. The Ouverture is quite ok: it has a neat, looping percussion track with weird samples, really reminiscent of the best moments in <strong>Zoolook</strong>, but melodywise, it's not very strong. Part 1 starts really weird, with strange, breathing noises, a faint accordion melody, and weird, almost dissonant strings later on... until it becomes a quite typical Jarre anthem for the rest of the suite. It's good and well-written and all, but it adds <em>nothing</em> to the <strong>Zoolook</strong> / <strong>Rendez-Vous</strong> legacy. It's not the kind of suite that would be very representative, and that should be placed in compilations or anything. Stick to <strong>Ethnicolor</strong> and <strong>Second Rendez-Vous</strong>, instead.</p>

<p>The title track, on the other hand, <em>is</em> quite different from what Jarre did until then. It combines a groovy, funky rhythm, Japanese-like flutes, Indian strings and Muslim chants, and a Vocodered voice speaking words like "freedom, change, TV, computer, employment", coming in with a loud "REVOLUTION" in the middle of strategically placed silences in the music. Well... the Vocoder trick sounds very Kraftwerkian (and quite old for 1988), and the combination of Middle Eastern elements into funky rhythms was done already by Brian Eno and David Byrne in <strong>My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts</strong>. That doesn't mean that the song doesn't <em>work</em>, though: the mixture of all those different elements works extraordinarily well, and this is one of the very few tracks that feature Middle Eastern chanting that sounds truly beautiful to me. Very good track. It just sounds a bit borrowed...</p>

<p>Aside from that, well... Jarre isn't at his peak of songwriting, but he still shows that he <em>knows</em> the importance of a good melody in a song: 'London Kid', the album's single, is like a mid-tempo synth rocker with the usual Jarre twist, and features some beautiful synth playing. I mean, it's not a melody worthy of 'Equinoxe 5', but it is <em>there</em>, and the song is arguably the best in the album. It's the most "conventional", too, as the other tracks all have some twist. 'Tokyo Kid' is really just a groovy trumpet jam over a slow, groovy rhythm. Actually, that trumpet faintly reminds me of <em>The Residents</em> in its slight out-of-tuneness. Jarre seems to put a lot of effort in making groovy, jerky rhythms in the album - maybe because he was listening to <em>way</em> too much <strong>My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts</strong>, or because he knew he should develop the rhythm to compensate for the lack of melodies to boot. The result is not particularly exciting, but quite good.</p>

<p>Other than that, there is 'Computer Weekend' - not at all related to Kraftwerk's <strong>Computer World</strong> (unfortunately), but related somewhat to 'Blah Blah Cafe'. You know, the idea is to set a "scene", like 'Blah Blah Cafe' did, but 'Computer Weekend' takes the traditional 'Louie Louie' chord sequence and goes to the beach. I'd say it sounds much nicer than 'Blah Blah Cafe', and you can create the scene perfectly in your mind - lots of children playing, people walking, seagulls, sunscreen, etc. 'September' is even better, though, in its delightful dorkiness. Jarre plays a simple tune in his synth, followed by what sounds like a choir of schoolboys going "nyah, nyah, nyah nyah nyah, nyah" over the melody. You know, I wonder if that is an <em>actual</em> choir going on, or some sampling trick, but the effect is funny. And the melody is catchy, too! And by the end, to complete the scene, you have some of those Gospel-like female wailings on top, but I have to admit that's some <em>good</em> Gospel-like wailing. I really hate those kinds of hysterical vocals, but the woman does a great job in here - not in the level of Clare Torry in 'The Great Gig In The Sky', but she sounds like she's <em>singing</em>, not yelling her lungs out to impress the listeners. Finally, there is 'The Emigrant', a majestic, pompous anthem that comes to close things for good. I guess this song is there as a hymn to the European emigrants arriving in their new homeland America in search of a new life and stuff, and I can see it played as a soundtrack for a scene like that in a movie, only that Jarre's song is probably much better than any cheesy crap they would be playing in movies, instead. Serious. I like 'The Emigrant' very much. There's one thing or two in that song that tingles on my nerves and gives me a warm feeling inside.</p>

<p>By the end of the day, I'll settle with a comfortable 10 for the album. It's <em>good</em>. Not much more than that, but it <em>is</em> solidly good. Jarre fans shouldn't dismiss it. While there are no truly outstanding tracks here, <strong>Revolutions</strong> is nice and pleasant, and Jarre's style is all over the place for people who <em>truly</em> dig the man. He could be repeating himself, but he could still <em>be</em> himself, even when copying others' ideas in 'Revolutions'. Okay, that was rude. Sorry. But he did borrow that Vocoder trick from Kraftwerk, now didn't he? He surely didn't borrow it from Mike frigging Oldfield.</p>

  <li>En Attendant Cousteau <span class="good">+</span></li>
</ol>

<p>Jarre goes epic. Yes, if you thought <strong>Rendez-Vous</strong> was epic enough, you oughta look <em>here</em> and make your own conclusions... Ok, maybe <strong>En Attendant Cousteau</strong> isn't more epic than <strong>Rendez-Vous</strong>, but it certainly is more ambitious, and in a way, more overblown. You see, this is a 69-minute album, and there are but <em>four</em> compositions in here - even though only one of them goes beyond the 20-minute mark, and far beyond that, I should add. No <strong>Tales From Topographic Oceans</strong> or <strong>Incantations</strong> to you!</p>

<p>Anyway, as you can deduce from the title, this album was inspired by Mr. Jacques Cousteau, who dedicated his life to study the South American Rainforests. Quite a noble goal, I should say, though I don't know <em>exactly</em> what was the intention here. Not that it matters much, anyway: you just have to be aware this album is dedicated to Cousteau, and you're all set. Especially in the title track. The title says "Waiting For Cousteau", and it's a 47-minute Ambient piece. No kidding. Jarre doing ambient? Yes, you read that right. And I'm <em>positive</em> that Jarre spent some time with his copy of <strong>Thursday Afternoon</strong> before he went to make this, because 'En Attendant Cousteau' is <em>exactly</em> the kind of piece influenced by the Ambient masterworks of Brian Eno: you have your droning D synth hum, you have some constant "chirping" like synths, you have the sparse piano notes reverberating into oblivion, you have some occasional noises... You know the rest. And this goes for 47-minutes. What do I say? Well, I say it's a quite excellent Ambient piece, thank you very much! For one, you gotta admire how <em>well</em> Jarre embraced the Ambient philosophy. This might have not been his first experiment with Ambient ideas, but it becomes clear that Sir Jean Michel worried about gathering the <em>essence</em> of Ambient, <em>not</em> only the fluff! Thus, you have a 47-minute "Waiting For Cousteau" piece that creates an atmosphere, a scene, a mood, or whatever, and tries to deliver a message. I'm not sure whether it's a negative or a positive message, but hey, most Ambient pieces are ambiguous - but I guess it's a positive message, otherwise it would be a very rude move against Cousteau. All in all, a great work.</p>

<p>But if you <em>really</em> aren't into Ambient... I don't know if it's very worth grabbing the CD at all, really. His three-part 'Calypso' isn't really hot. Right after falling in the fatal clich&eacute; trap in <strong>Revolutions</strong>, Jarre seems to steadily go on in the same direction. It was obvious that he was more worried with his Ambient thingy, anyway. For one, as soon as the album began, and I heard those "watery" noises swirling about, I thought to myself "well, when is the low-pitched, ominous string-immitating synth is going to come, mr Jarre?"... Well, imagine my surprise when I was greeted with a blast of percussion and a bass line reminiscent of <strong>Les Chants Magn&egrave;tiques</strong>! After a few seconds of an excourse into Caribbean (!) music, I realised that the first track is, indeed, a "Calypso"! And I have to say, I love this track, if only for the sheer surprise of hearing it at the very beginning of an "epic" album like this. But it's really surprising how Jarre takes those typical Caribbean sounds and melodies and molds them into something <em>substantial</em>, not into a mere "hey, look! Caribbean music!" trick. Ok, perhaps the song is a bit overreaching at 8 minutes, but still, I can't help enjoying every note and every chord produced by Jarre's blessed synths. Oh, Jarre, how clever of you to showcase your unique talents even in your most so-so albums. I praise thee!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the low-pitched ominous synth-immitating strings <em>do</em> come in when 'Calypso, part 2' begins, and it's really a very typical Jarre anthem, going back to the worst moments in 'Industrial Revolution'. It has all the ominousness, and 3 or 4 minutes in, it transforms itself into an upbeat anthem, but overall, it's not a very inspired track. It sorely lacks in true melodies or true atmospheres. And 'Fin De Si&egrave;cle'? Imagine a <em>huge</em>, reverberating bass kick and a snare drum with a weird "spinning" treatment plodding slowly, and you can imagine where this song goes. Yes, it's a sweeping, emotional anthem of hope, or at least, it tries to be. It has a melody, but by this time, it becomes clear that Jarre couldn't write a melody as powerful as he did for 'Fourth Rendez-Vous' anymore. It's grandiose, 6-minutes long, and has huge coda and all, but it's too much pomp with little substance. Sorry. It's not rotten, though. Nope, neither of these two tracks are rotten. Lacklustre, maybe, but not rotten. See, Jarre didn't release <em>a single</em> truly lacklustre album in his carreer so far. Even this one still presents 'Calypso' and 'En Attendant Cousteau', and because of that, I'm forced to give it a slightly-high rating. But if you don't enjoy - or worse, <em>despise</em> - Ambient, you'll probably want to lower the rating considerably... and even more if you don't enjoy - or <em>despise</em> - Caribbean music. If that's the case, well, you're in bad luck.</p>

<p>Well, apparently, Jarre missed his "one big song" schtick, and guess what? He revived the formula! It's back to the roots, baby, a genuine return to the origins. Or is it? Oh, I'll say it is, and that's that. In structure, this is as "classic" as a Jarre album can be: one single instrumental piece, divided in 8 parts. But musically? Well... To begin with, where is the atmosphere? Where are the rich textures of the synthesizers under absolute control of the Master? Well, they're in <strong>Equinoxe</strong>, of course. This album doesn't seem to focus on visions, atmospheres, settings or whatever. The concept here is <em>even</em> more abstract, you see: "Chronologie"? Time doesn't have a "sound", like the bubbly waters of <strong>Equinoxe</strong> or the chilly winds of <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong> have. So, instead of expecting something along the lines of his three first classic LPs, you'll have to expect <em>something else</em>.</p>

<p>And what is it? I, er, I dunno. I honestly don't know what kind of "chronology" the album represents. Is it a look at different epochs of mankind? Perhaps. But I don't care, after all: it's the music, not the atmosphere, that matters here... or was <em>supposed</em> to matter. The music here isn't really earth-shattering and flabbergasting, to Jarre's standards. But, of course, you may like the album much, much more than good ole <strong>Equinoxe</strong> and <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong> for your own, personal reasons, since Jarre's music is so open to interpretation. Me? Well, I like it a lot. Most of it is reasonably excellent. The thematics of "chronology" completely pass me by, but that's no problem. The music is able to cast very different moods and scenes, and just the fact that it <em>casts</em> moods and scenes means this album can enter the selection of Jarre classics without problems. See, albums like this are much more compact and concise than your <strong>Revolutions</strong>, for example. Besides, the musical ideas feel much more comfortable in their place. There aren't the "usual" anthems and dirges to play their roles simply because it is a Jarre album, and the "different" stuff isn't so isolated. Do you know <em>what</em> I'm talking about? No? Eh, me neither.</p>

<p>I guess it's just the fact that there are better melodies, and the bombastic synth sounds seem to have a meaning, and not falling like another clich&eacute;. Or maybe it's the nostalgic value? There are very interesting similarities between this album and his three firsts: side two begins with a "pop" single (the fourth part), there are transitional, rhythmic parts as well as transitional, atmospheric parts, and the album ends with a "musical joke". The difference is that the first part is ten minutes long, much longer than any other track - and this structure would be followed on the following album. But most important is the fact that the ten-minute opening is grandiose, majestic and anthemic. Overblown? Heh, that depends on how you take Jarre's music. I take it as a statement of victory, or something - perhaps as a sequel to <strong>Rendez-Vous</strong>, with similar string-immitating pads and an overall "orchestral" arrangement. But after the build-up of orchestra, the song turns into a slow, quiet, meditative piece. And part 2 takes over with a church organ, and a certain dramatic, fast rhythm. And when it fades away, a dramatic, slow dirge takes over with part 3, presenting even a guitar solo by one Patrick Rondat. Great music, but what does it mean?</p>

<p>If you're sensitive to that stuff, these twenty minutes might be a rollercoaster ride to you. To me, it's great music, so whatever. And like I said, the second half of the album begins with a "pop" tune. And in just a few seconds, part 4 turns into a "plop-plop" electronic dancey tune... Predictable, you know, but the melody is good enough. It brings good melodies of the sunny, happy atmosphere of 'Equinoxe 5', but melody-wise, it's inferior. And after it ends, the album loses steam considerably. The great melody goes away, and you're left to the rhythm, and not much more. Yeah, a synth riff pops up here and there, but they're pretty much like 'Equinoxe 6' without the clever, interlocked riffs and lines. Part 6 <em>continues</em> the trend, probably as a transitional piece. And part 7 is... another transitional piece? Very mysterious, this time around, beginning with the freaky sounds of bees. Bees scare me out of my skin. Gee, thanks a lot, Jay Em Jay.</p>

<p>At least, part 8 relieves all that vacant space with a majestic, glorious church organ. Choirs, timpani, guitar, all joining forces towards a glorious major chord and... Funky rhythm. Musical joke, you know. I like those brass lines, and the ending - it's majestic crossed with humourous. Great stuff. And when someone starts a slow countdown, what do you expect?... Hmm, it just returns to a loop of clock sounds, just like it began. Cyclical.</p>

<p>You might not want to worry too much about my comments here. Jarre's music is very, very subjective, you know. But it's my firm belief that the album is inferior to his first ones, melody-wise. The arrangements are very lush and rich, of course, and I won't be cynical to say that's just because of Jarre's plethora of expensive synthesizers. Music isn't great just because of the synthesizers! Go listen to the mid-90's Mike Oldfield albums to see it for yourself. There's a lot of talent involved. Anyway, don't expect to love it if you do buy the album. If you <em>do</em> love it, it will be a pleasant surprise!</p>

<p>Hi !</p>

<p>It is not Adrian Belew, who plays guitar on Part 3; it's Patrick Rondat, a french heavy-metal guitarist !<br />
(Check out his solo work "Amphibia", produced by Jarre)</p>

<p>Great page, therefore. Seems, that we like the same artists. I also write reviews for the German Prog Magazine 'Babyblaue Seiten', unfortunately in German. (http://www.babyblaue-seiten.de). When I have some time, I put some Reviews in English on my personal Site.</p>

<p>Another question: Do you hear Adrian Belew's parts on '<strong>Zoolook</strong>' ? I'm not sure at all about it - it would be nice to know, which noises do have the origin of  his guitar.<br />
<span class="edNote">[editor's note: Well, I don't remember clearly of any guitar parts on <strong>Zoolook</strong>, but that's no wonder, considering all the weird noises everywhere. One of these days, I might give a closer listen to it, and see if I can make out any clear guitar parts.]</span></p>

  Best song: <em>Errr... </em><big>Oxyg&egrave;ne 8</big><em>?</em>

<p>Oh, no. Jarre is trying to cash-in on the <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong> name. Well... perhaps not, actually. It's hard to say if this is a cash-in or an actual artistic statement and a labour of love for his breakthrough album. Though I should say, I'm not excited with this "continuation" of <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong>... Firstly because I don't think <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong> is the greatest thing ever. I love it, but I'm not a rabid fan of it as I am a rabid fan of <strong>Equinoxe</strong>. But even still, I wouldn't be so excited with the idea of <strong>Equinoxe 8-17</strong>, either... I'm not bitching, I just think Jarre is foolish to try and <em>go back</em> to do something he had already done. During his glory years, he was always moving forwards, trying different things. Now, he tries to live in his past glories? Hmm... doesn't smell right to me.</p>

<p>I can't say either <em>what</em> motivated Jarre to make this sequel. I don't think he was obssessing on <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong> the same way Mike Oldfield obssessed on <strong>Tubular Bells</strong>, mostly because Jarre seems to be satisfied with the original album - so much, in fact, that this is the <em>continuation</em> of the album - not a "sequel" as <strong>Tubular Bells II</strong> is. And I should add that this album is <em>that</em> much better than <strong>Tubular Bells II</strong>, and that Jarre had enough common sense not to make <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne 14-21</strong> and <strong>The Millenium Oxy</strong>, and I hardly think he'll make <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne 2006</strong>, either. See? I don't think this is a cash-in, really.</p>

<p>So, if it's not a cash-in, I have no reason to be cynical about it. So, I'll be honest with myself and consider <em>only</em> the feelings I have for the music here, be it a "continuation" or not. And what <em>are</em> my feelings about it? Hmm... First, let's get to the facts. Jarre is obviously trying to cast a similar atmosphere to the original <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong>, but instead of using his 70's synths and Mellotrons, he's counting on his array of hi-tech digital synthesizers and whatnot (though I heard that he <em>did</em> use some actual vintage synthesizers here). So, for those who listen to this stuff very closely, they won't help noticing that the sounds here are... more sterile than before. That's definitely a problem, and even more when the 7th part, that opens the album, is a <em>direct</em> reprise of the famous 4th part. The melody is way different, but the rhythm, chords and sounds are definitely very similar. That, the 9th part (a sort of 'Oxyg&egrave;ne 1' backwards), and the 13th part (a "musical joke" with a Latin rhythm) are the only bits of "nostalgia" in the album. The rest? Well, it derives much more from <strong>Chronologie</strong>! Just see for yourself how the first part is twelve minutes long, and how the two parts near the end are very rhythmic and "plop-plop" happy.</p>

<p>But here lies the rub: the <em>mood</em> is vastly different from <strong>Chronologie</strong>, and more faithful to <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong>. It evokes O2, not time. The <em>way</em> in which it evokes O2, though, <em>is</em> derivative from <strong>Chronologie</strong>: rhythmic, energetic and restless. What does that mean? It's clear to me: it's an updated view on the themes of <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong>. And that is why I respect this album much more than <strong>Tubular Bells II</strong> - Jarre isn't trying to change history. He's just revisiting a piece he has seen before, but getting different vibrations from it, and expressing it in different ways. That makes the album, at least, interesting to me. And I don't mean "interesting" as in "curious": I mean interesting as in <em>worth having</em>.</p>

<p>But then, I'm not going to say I love the album to bits. I don't. I'm glad that it exists, I'm glad I have it, but I don't rank it up there with classics like <strong>Les Chants Magn&egrave;tiques</strong>. But I like it more than <strong>Chronologie</strong> - at least, I've grown to like it more. And why? Well, because the album is more <em>fun</em> to listen. The first part, "sterile" synths or not, introcues a deadly simple, but deadly effective melody, and it <em>grows</em> very nicely, travelling through different moods and arrangements. Part 9, nostalgic or not, suffers a bit from the synths trying to bring back that ominous, imposing sound of the first part, but it's still very cleverly put together. And while I'm not really sure about ending the album with another "joke" (it makes the album sound like a "second" thing, not like a seamless continuation), it's a beautiful song.</p>

<p>The "new" parts are definitely more entertaining... maybe because they <em>are</em> new. Part 8 is amazing, creating a lush, full and clean sound around you. I could call it a "wall of sound", but it would have to be an aethereal, cosmic wall of sound. But, of course, the song wouldn't be that good if it didn't have a great, simple melody cutting through. Part 10 has a definite "futuristic" sound and a Theremin-like sound (or probably it <em>is</em> a Theremin). And the following two parts kick in with fast, frantic "plop-plop" rhythms, but it's just impressive to hear all those interlocking synths and entwined themes. Pretty impressive work.</p>

<p>So, yeah, count this album as a good addition to your Jarre collection. You may like it less than me, of course, but I already remarked how subjective Jarre's music is. So, whatever. Count me happy, a 12 it is.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most controversial Jarre album, this one. And I have to admit, I had my hopes very low for this one. It was released on early 2000, and apparently showed a very different sound for Jarre. And that was my biggest fear... that this album would be simply Generic Techno. After all, being the electronica dude that Jarre always was, it was only a matter of time before he started dabbling with Techno music, the plop-plop-plop rhythms that were so vogue at the time, and he had already shown a penchant for these rhythms on <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne 7-13</strong>. And this was it, this was Jarre's final descent into mediocrity, doing trendy, "hip" music, trying to keep up with the times. And having heard some samples of the album, I was already decided that this album was <em>the shit</em>, and ready to give my final judgement. Heck, even the song titles suck: 'Hey Gagarin'? 'Love Love Love'? 'Millions Of Stars'? You can only guess where my expectations were at that time.</p>

<p>And with a couple of listens, I came to figure it out... Damn, but this album isn't bad! It's not bad <em>at all</em>! Really! I have to amdit that my initial disappointment with the album was because I <em>hate</em> generic Techno, and I have a huge prejudice against music that uses such rhythms and sounds with bad results. But, believe me, this is <em>not</em> the case here. Actually, on first listen, it's very easy to dismiss the album as a lump of mediocrity, and I almost did so. If your brain is turned off and ready to decline everything that the album tries to offer you, you won't notice nothing at all that's likeable on the album. But amazingly, I was able to let the album sink in, and I have to tell you, I <em>really</em> like it now. In the second listen, I was amazed already that the whole album was <em>listenable</em>, and I didn't feel sick at any of it! And now, I have lots of good things to tell about this album. Take it from me: if <em>I</em>, who had to cope with a <em>lot</em> of garbage Techno music in my life, say good things about this record, <em>no way</em> it can be as bad as you might think it is.</p>

<p>Say, these tracks are pretty much variations on Techno rhythms. But this stuff is <em>tame</em>, in the sense that it's not trying to hipnotise you, to mesmerise you, to hammer insistent and neverchanging rhythms and synth themes into your head. It's <em>not</em> that kind of dance music. In fact, I can hardly think anyone can dance to this stuff. Jarre takes these rhythms and treats them with care, respect, studies them, analyses them, and does something <em>tasteful</em> with them. And with <em>tasteful</em>, I'm saying that he adds little melodic touches, instruments, classy little twists, lyrics (in French and English, most times interspersed), and all that kind of stuff. Look at the second track, for example: 'C'est La Vie', the longest on the CD, is speedy, thumping and features a woman singing and strings playing those Middle-Eastern motifs that Jarre already explored on 'Revolutions'. If you're not paying attention, you might think it's just a half-arsed attempt to do something "trendy". I know it because <em>I</em> did so, initially. But this stuff sounds nice! It sounds clear to me that Jarre was willing to really understand this new trend of music and try to absorb it. And that's where he differs from people like, say, Mike Oldfield, who also used Techno rhythms on his 1999 album, <strong>The Millennium Bell</strong>. While he was simply doing Techno because everyone else was doing so, and it seemed to fit the idea of his album, Jarre is truly willing to go further than that. And it seems clear, to me, that Jarre was putting a lot of effort on his work. And so, you can gleefully put 'C'est La Vie' next to 'The Millennium Bell' and realise that the former rules and the latter blows.</p>

<p>'Tout Est Bleu' is the one that most smells like generic Techno, and it includes a woman saying some words to a weather forecast and the buzzes and hisses of a modem, before a choir sings some catchy lines to the pump-pump rhythm. I'm amazed at myself that I like this song, but I do. The woman's voice and the modem hisses might be just a throwaway gimmick, but at least, they don't sound uncalled for. Still in the uptempo note and to draw more comparisons with Mr. Oldfield, 'Bells' features... well, bells playing a <em>very</em> Jarresque melody. Yep, I said melody, not a small, stupid, obnoxious riff played ad infinitum on an annoying, buzzing synth. And tell me whatever you wish, but this one song is <em>far</em> better than 'Far Above The Clouds', for example, if only because it includes an actual melody and dismisses the pomp and circumstance of Oldfield's piece of shit.</p>

<p>That's not to say that this album does not include a couple of duffers... 'Love Love Love' managed to annoy me with a <em>severely</em> affected female vocal, but even that one brings a couple of melodic ideas. And 'Rendez-Vous A Paris', a slower, funkier groove, falls a little on the "uninteresting" side, featuring just a constant, three-note riff and a Vocodered voice reciting the track title several times. But still, that one features a classy violin solo that sounds really great in the context of the song. The opening track, 'Je Me Souviens' has an annoying "khh, khh, khh, khh, khh" synth going on, but it has a neat atmosphere, piano tinklings, and little tricks with sound effects. While this might sound like another cheap gimmick (and I do admit it kinda sounds like you're listening to a pinball machine at times), you can just let it flow and collaborate to the atmosphere.</p>

<p>And everywhere else there are pleasant, even beautiful sonic paintings on 'Hey Gagarin', the weird 'Miss Moon', the beautiful 'Gloria, Lonely Boy' and in the gorgeous 'Millions Of Stars'. That song is where the album really slows down considerably, and it sounds very close to 'Oxyg&egrave;ne 1' - and I'm sure Jarre was aware of that, even throwing those bubbly effects. And I have to admit that having a female voice speaking the names of the notes the piano plays is a classy touch. And I should mention 'Give Me A Sign', too, that has a beautiful melody that's slightly reminiscent of <strong>Rendez-Vous</strong>.</p>

<p>Really, I like this record. It's not one of his greatest, but it leaves a nifty impression. You might not like it, though. It's an album that you really have to allow yourself to like, or else it simply doesn't work. You might be turned off by the gimmicks, or you can listen to them as classy, little touches, and concentrate on the meatier aspects of the album. I have to admit that the Vocodered voices sound a bit, you know, <em>old</em> by now, but it's ok. What matters is, none of these tricks are <em>forced</em>, or feel out-of-place. Jarre really absorbed this new style of music, and instead of following the trends and using formulas and recycled ideas, he tries to create his own. Yes, he <em>tries</em>. Whether he succeeded or not, the Techno and Dance connoisseurs will want to discuss. But I will just enjoy this album while I can, and indeed, I won't be embarrassed to put this one once in a while, when I need my blood to be pumped a bit faster. Just don't play it on a dance club, if you're a DJ.</p>

<p>Now, can anyone explain me this? Well, look, I simply have no idea why this album exists. To newcomers, I'll explain what I know: the album and track titles are all very self-explanatory. And from what we can gather, these tracks are the simple results of Jarre's studio sessions that happened through the year of 2000, and nothing more. The sound of these tracks? Well, Jarre is employing all of his hi-tech synths and creating those loops of funky drum machines, strange chord sequences and whatnot, while someone picks a seemingly random instrument and solos all over. And that's mostly that.</p>

<p>Yup, there isn't anything <em>really</em> interesting about these tracks. They are lengthy (the shortest one clocks at almost 5 minutes), there isn't really any melodic content in any of these tracks, and all you're bound to listen to is a bunch of improvisation. There <em>are</em> variations in sound from track to track: sometimes Jarre picks a more aggressive rhythm, sometimes jazzy, sometimes funky, something nothing; sometimes he throws his atmospheric synth chords, and sometimes there are blurches of sound effects and samples; and the solos. Sometimes it's a violoncello, sometimes a vibraphone, sometimes a lap steel, sometimes piano... and that's it. All these tracks are pretty monotonous, too. If you hear one minute of any of these tracks, what you should expect until the end are variations of that same minute.</p>

<p>Since these are really studio sessions, it's understandable that Jarre and his mates felt like simply improvising away. It's like a band jamming: but things are way more electronic, automatic, and the solos aren't <em>all</em> that interesting, you see. If you wish, they are some sort of very lazy "Free Jazz", but I wouldn't know for very sure. What I mean is, I have <em>no idea</em> why Jarre decided to release this stuff as an album. It isn't fun to listen to - perhaps <em>interesting</em>, but not fun. I know there are certainly people that enjoy this kind of stuff, but I'm not one of them, pure and simple. As it is, I just see no reason for this album to exist. Even more because Jarre didn't seem to <em>do</em> anything with this. There don't seem to be melodies or themes being constructed here, and if they were, Jarre absolutely didn't use them in his next album, <strong>Geometry Of Love</strong>. Ok, maybe the sound is similar, but heck, it is <em>sound</em>, not ideas or atmospheres.</p>

<p>And I'm frankly kinda annoyed at this stuff. Some tracks reach a certain level of niftiness and all of them are listenable, but... eh. The second session picks up that typical 90's rhythm and throws some chords and stuff, and there's a trumpet soloing. Problem is, there are only two or three little trumpet lines in here, and they are repeated <em>all the way</em> through the track, with only slight differences in position. Halfway through there is a strings section (I suppose) and a lap steel, but not even then it goes somewhere interesting. It's not like the guys are interested in seeing <em>where</em> the song is going - it's like they simply lay it there and let things play themselves in a loop, and then go have a beer somewhere, and arrive to take the results and release them. At least <em>that</em> is the feeling I get. At least the May 1 session is quite cool, with atmospheric piano and all. Say, it's probably the only track here that I'd like to listen to a couple of times in the future.</p>

<p>And then, that's mostly it. The September 14 session smells like Jazz with some violoncello and some vibes and some drums, the June 21 one has some strange synth solo and organ, January 24 has some cool cello, and December 17 has even <em>more</em> cello... but this time around, all it plays is a cool line on which Jarre applies a cool, echoeing effect, but they play it <em>so many times</em> it becomes a pain by the end. And what more can I say? I dunno, I'm not even sure what rating I should give it. I just don't enjoy it. Maybe you'll do, if you have a certain penchant for <em>this</em> kind of music. But I don't. At least, I'll give Jarre the merit of doing something radically different with <em>decent</em> results. This stuff is <em>far</em> from atrocious, and let's face it: were Jarre a less competent musician, I doubt I would even manage to <em>listen</em> to this stuff.</p>

<p>I hate the INS key, by the way.</p>

<p>Well, well, well. It's 2003, and Jarre releases a new album. We've been used to seeing former great artists collapsing into total genericism in this new millenium, and at first listens to this album, I felt that Jarre had finally succumbed to the same fate as Mike Oldfield. ... well, not quite. Mike simply thinks that he can release whatever he wants and that his fans will still hold every note he produces as utter genius (and they actually do). The result is <strong>Tr3s Lunas</strong>. And Jarre, well, Jarre seems to have finally collapsed into the mainstream. The result is <strong>Geometry Of Love</strong>.</p>

<p>I mean, on first listen, I was <em>truly</em> turned off by the sound of this album. Not that it's <em>bad</em> by definition, but I <em>really</em> don't like this, uh, "style" of music. This is the "electronica" of the New Millenium: Slow, funky drum machine loops, hi-tech synth effects, synth sweeps with low attack and no release (as if they're played backwards), dizzy piano lines, and faint traces of melody slammed against the canvas, backed by moody "atmosphere". And I was only used to listen to this kind of stuff on TV vignettes and stuff, so this CD was <em>really</em> irritating. However, this is just one of those silly "personal taste" things. I listened to this album more, and suddenly I realised that it is <em>good</em>. Very good, in fact. "Very good" as in, "a little more and I can say it's <em>great</em>".</p>

<p>And it is really refreshing to see that Jarre can change his style and sound, and still be good at it. Mind you, I still <em>far</em> prefer the 70's Jarre to this "new" Jarre: the melodies, the rich textures and atmospheres, the melodies, the rich textures and atmospheres, the melodies... You know, but I'm not going to complain about <em>that</em>, because it's useless. The undeniable fact is that this album isn't based on refined melodies. So, if you expect some kind of masterpiece to the levels of <strong>Oxyg&egrave;ne</strong>, well, you're bound to be disappointed. So, what to do? Take the album for what it is, of course! And that's how I learned to like this album. I don't <em>love</em> it, but I really like it.</p>

<p>So, if we're to take the album for what it is, what <em>is</em> it, then? Well, um, it's Geometric, and definitely Lovely. It seems to be a concept album, and not just because of the track titles. All songs are very moody and atmospheric, and these moods and atmospheres work together. In fact, this is an album that works much better when you listen to it all instead of going track by track, saying "hmm, this is a good one... Hmm, this is not so good... etc." The album invites you into its little atmospheric world, and once your immersed, you are able to enjoy it all. As such, the opener, 'Pleasure Principle', is very intriguing and mysterious, with its orchestral main theme and stuff.</p>

<p>Not that all songs are <em>great</em>. They <em>work</em>, but not all of them are <em>great</em>. 'Skin Paradox' and 'Electric Flesh' are the two most "modern sounding" ones, and the least charming ones, actually. The two part title track is better, with a funky rhythm, a looping synth theme, and a melody with a sampled female voice in the second part - yes, like 'Zoolookologie'. My favourites include 'Soul Intrusion', with a mysterious, hypnotic synth loop, and the very beautiful 'Velvet Road', that puts almost everything from <strong>Tr3s Lunas</strong> to shame.</p>

<p>The <em>real</em> problem with this record, the only thing that prevents me from raising the rating to a 9 or higher, is the lack of identity. There is <em>nothing</em> in here that gives you a hint that it is <em>Jean Michel Jarre</em> who wrote these songs. Even <strong>Revolutions</strong>, for example, has that classic "tint" of Jarre, but this one doesn't. And this is one point where it loses to <strong>Tr3s Lunas</strong>: even in a sea of chill-out genericism, Mike could still play his twangy electric guitar, so everyone could recognise the sound by far. Of course, you can also see this as a <em>flaw</em>, meaning that Mike spends his entire life playing that <em>same</em> things (which isn't really true - he only played the same kind of guitar for 10 years straight). So, whatever, take this as a successful "change of sound" for Jarre - after all, it's not everyday you see a <em>piano instrumental</em> ('Near Djaina') coming from the hands of our Synth Wizard. And yes, it is successful, because the album is very good. Get this one instead of <strong>Tr3s Lunas</strong>: at the very least, this one doesn't have an obnoxious sax-guitar masturbating in every spot.</p>

  <big>Fun factor:  <strong>12/15</strong></big> - Well, it is moody, and quite erotic, and keeps you entertained while it lasts.<br />
  <big>Resonance:   <strong>12/15</strong></big> - Well, it is moody, and quite erotic... er, it's not supposed to <em>"turn you on"</em>, mind you, but it works very well.<br />
  <big>Originality: <strong>10/15</strong></big> - Well, er... um, whatever.<br />
  <big>Richness:    <strong>11/15</strong></big> - Remember: the melodic content on here is almost non-existant. You'll have to find something other than melodies to cling onto.<br />
  <big>Solidness:   <strong>12/15</strong></big> - Solid, it certainly is.
