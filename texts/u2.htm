<p>A funny band, this Irish quartet. Everybody knows them, but not many people know them well. This is the truth. What is the <em>real</em> U2, then? Hard to tell. My best bet is that they are an decently skilled rock band that are merely trying to be, um, unique. They are ambitious, that's for sure. And if we follow their career through the years, we'll see that they were never the same. Unlike Radiohead, for example, who has been evolving into the world of Art-rock and experimentalism, U2 has been running all over the place trying to do the right thing.</p>

<p>When they were young, back in the late 70's, they were merely a rock band that drew influences from Punk and New Wave, mostly, and went into studio to record one of the most amazing albums of the early 80's, <strong>Boy</strong>. From then on, it's hard to really tell what are they intentions. They started to get into religion, and their lyrics, from then on, have always had something to do with religion, yet in a subtle and effective way. They went hard rockin', they went artsy, then they went... pop, then they went, uh... techno. Were they trying to be "cool" and follow the fashion? Or they were trying not to end as a "washed up" band from the 80's?</p>

<p>It's very common to see people putting apart the 80's U2 and the 90's U2. And it ain't hard to see why. 80's U2 was extremely rock oriented, was marked by a very successful collaboration with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, and culminated with <strong>The Joshua Tree</strong>, and finished with the ambitious and pompous <strong>Rattle And Hum</strong>. However, the 90's began with an abrupt 180° turn with <strong>Achtung Baby</strong>, when U2 jumped in the bandwagon of 90's pop. From then on, they started getting deep into Electronica, releasing the controversial <strong>Pop</strong>, and then back to lightweight pop with <strong>All That You Can't Leave Behind</strong>.</p>

<p>But what's really their business? Did they do real good music or not? Well, U2 is a band that has many aspects that can be discussed for ages. Mr McPhisto, aka Bono, has a legion of worshippers who rave over his singing and his lyrics. As a singer, he's definitely impressive. Through their "hard rockin'" era, his voice was remarkable almost solely by the raw power in it. However, he has always been exploring the use of more subtle tones, and bringing them to full effect with really beautiful performances. And age hardly interfered with it. The Edge also has many people who rave over his guitar skills. What do I think of him? Well, you gotta admit, when it comes to 'skills', The Edge is merely decent and isn't worth to lick Mike Oldfield's boots. But he surely was creative enough to employ many different guitar tricks and come up with interesting results. In the <strong>Boy</strong> era, his guitar was overpowered with so much reverb you could lose yourself in one single note from his strings. But since the Brian Eno era, he has been going back to a more subtle and solid style. The drum / bass combo, however, is terrific. They have been elected somewhere as the best one in Europe, and while I'd <em>never</em> put them above John Deacon / Roger Taylor (or for a ridiculously unfair match, John Entwistle / Keith Moon, heh heh), they were certainly among the best of their time. Adam Clayton has always been a good bassist, and Larry Mullen has been evolving with the use of his sticks enough to make him, at least, respectable.</p>

<p>In the songwriting area, they have always been solid enough to hardly come up with a stinker in their early albums. But after <strong>Achtung Baby</strong>, they started going extremely hit-and-miss. Also, Bono's lyrics began to trust too much on wacky metaphors and inane speeches, making them a dangerous aspect to discuss. So, we'd better begin the album reviews right away before I go on rambling endlessly. Draw your own conclusions.</p>

<p>Kids. They were kids when they made this. And they weren't even willing to hide it. Geez, they actually used that as a <em>point</em> to the album. Just read the album title, if you will! And see the album cover, if you will: some kid that lived across the street, chosen for no specific reason whatsoever. Just a boy. They were just boys; not <em>special</em> or important boys: just boys who happened to record some successful singles. And that's no surprise. They were a talented bunch, as this record shows. And even more: they <em>cared</em> about their music. Just listening to the music is enough for one to notice that.</p>

<p>It should also be clear that this music is quite different from what U2 would go on to make in the future, and that fact combined with the small amount of "hits" in the record makes it one of the most overlooked albums in their carreer.Maybe not most <em>overlooked</em>, but most unjustly so. This is a kind of music that the band simply would never make again, or even be able to make again: unpretentious, simple and direct, no frills, just thrills. It's down to Earth, humble but strong, shameless and honest, pessimistic but not depressing. There's no messianism here at all: Bono deals with the challenges and doubts of growing up without his mother. There are suggestions of suicide regarding that, even. Yes, it's a pretty dark album - and not only lyrically! See, Bono's lyrics are one part of the music. And the music itself? Well, it's much better than the lyrics. Not that the lyrics suck, see, but the music is so brilliant that the lyrics are almost - and I said <em>almost</em> - unnecessary. The band got a really great sound going, in which all instruments join together in some sort of dark tunnel, but in a very organied fashion, so it doesn't sound like a big mess. It's true that the production is kinda muddy, but in a good way! It gives the album a delightful, amateurish feel,and makes it rough enough to deliver the message across convincingly. The Edge shows right from the start how to extract some REALLY good lines and riffs out of his guitar, and the solos are economic and to the point. The rhythm section <em>never</em> falters, not even for a second, and Bono's vocals burn with energy. And that's the recipe for virtually all tracks!</p>

<p>See, there are so little tracks here that I'd dare to discard that I don't even know if I talk of them <em>first</em>to take them out of the way, or leave them to later on because they aren't weak enough to be important. Yeah, better talk about the good ones first. And all of side A is fantastic, in my opinion. And it isn't even because of 'I Will Follow', the sole big hit of the album, even though it's still a fantastic post-punkish rocker. Edge's guitar riff is so utterly simple it's almost banal, but the real good thing is how it mixes in well to the rhythm section. And they add those glockenspiel runs to it, as well as the sound of a screwdriver hitting on a spinning bicycle wheel, giving it the sound of a disimbodied childhood. Catchy chorus, too! But the following tracks just keep improving on that. 'Twilight' is slower and heavier, growing from darkish "mid-tempo" verses into intense choruses and an even more intense instrumental break, topped with that memorable guitar riff made of three-note arpeggios. That song comes in a good time to nail down that echoey, creepy sound that runs through the rest of the album. But in terms of creepiness, it's nothing compared to 'An Cat Dubh'. What's particularly good about that song is how it combines that eerie, dissonant riff with disimbodied noises and glockenspiel tinkling without at all sounding forced. Oh yes, and it never sounds willing to stick to <em>one</em> tempo, but I have no idea whether that's because the band can't keep up a slow rhythm, or if it's supposed to speed up that way. What matters is that it's great, and features more of that fierce instrumental passages.</p>

<p>The best thing about it, though, is near the end, when it quiets down, with eerie but gentle guitar harmonics, to a sole one-note bass line, over which Edge lies the fantastic intro to 'Into The Heart'. His solo is every bit as tender, gorgeous and tense, at the same time, as it could possibly be. That intro takes up almost half of the length of the song (I have to warn that I've seen CDs indexing it as the end of 'An Cat Dubh', but I'm following my original LP issue here), and that's partly why the song is my favourite on the record, <em>and</em> one of my favourite U2 songs ever, rivalling classics like 'Bad'. Eventually, the solo leads into some very short sung verses, when the song erupts into a full band performance, but it doesn't last for long, and goes back to where it came from, eventually. Oh, yes, sure, and it leads into the fast 'Out Of Control', which extends a bit on the 'I Will Follow' kind of rocking, but brighter, and... um, more uplifting, I guess. I just know that the three-chord riff is damn memorable, and the vocal melody is <em>really</em> catchy... well, it's just an adaptation of the guitar riff, after all. And there's even a quiet, hushed middle part in the song! Classy.</p>

<p>As you might have guessed, side B doesn't quite compared to side A. It's a bit "looser", and the songs don't have the same potential - in particular 'Stories For Boys', that's basically a recycling of 'I Will Follow', but not a very inspired one. That doesn't mean I would discard the side completely! 'Another Time, Another Place' is also slightly less inspired than the others, but it's still a very good mid-tempo song, with one of Edge's best solos. I'm terribly fond of 'A Day Without Me', with one of the clearest suggestions of suicide in the record, but payed over an upbeat, positive rhythm with beautiful guitar work as usual. But the whole song is countered by a strangely sad sing-along finale, which makes the track go entirely against itself. Sounds weird? Well, it's just a clever twist by clever kids. I like Bono's vocals here. I really like Bono's vocals in the album, in fact. Another very interesting thing on this side of the record is 'The Ocean', a very short tune with a gentle, haunting bass rhythm providing foundation by some very haunting guitar lines and a haunting vocal melody. Get the picture? It lasts for about one minute and a half, and is beautiful and haunting enough to make its presence worthwhile here. It doesn't even sound out of place!</p>

<p>At the end of the album, they get things going again with 'The Electic Co.'. It's not one of the most well written rockers in the album, but the performance is just as good as everything here, with an echo effect applied to the guitar to make the riff groovier than it is (but it might <em>not</em> be an echo unit, though). And to finish the album, there's the ballad 'Shadows And Tall Trees', which is maybe a bit too long and meandering, but it gets a solid mood going. In particular, I like the way the drums progessively stomp harder as the song goes, and with the other instruments, seem to lead to an almost anthemic finale, before it just vanishes away. Works extremely well as an album closer. Really, the album is pretty much perfect the way it is. At least the highlights are all firmly in place. And, yes, they would never go back to making <em>this</em> kind of music again - to the point that I was genuinely <em>puzzled</em> when <strong>All That You Can't Leave Behind</strong> was announced as a "return to their roots". Maybe it was just a marketing trick, or something, because there's no comparison whatsoever with this album and what came after it - see, already on the second album, Bono was getting his Christian ambitions, and the overblownness was starting to show. There is no overblownness whatsoever in this album, because the band wasn't aiming at anything in particular here: they were just being faithful to their style. And it worked, just because that style was so interesting; AND because the execution is flawlessly flawed, rough-around-the-edges and also interesting. I just love it.</p>

<p>And while we're talking about the LP issue, on my copy, a few seconds after the last track, there's a brief, muffled fragment of an instrumental take of 'Fire', from the next album. Before I knew what it is, that bit creeped the hell out of me; and even <em>after</em> I knew it, too. Eek. It seems to come from outer space, like an alien transmission.</p>

<h2 id="october">October (1981)</h2>
<p class="medium">
  Best song: <big>Gloria</big>
</p>
<div class="medium">
  Track list:
</div>
<ol class="trackList">
  <li><span class="good">Gloria ++</span></li>
  <li>I Fall Down <span class="good">+</span></li>
  <li>I Threw A Brick Through A Window</li>

</ol>

<p>Call it artistic maturity, evolution, growth, or whatever you wish. <strong>October</strong> is still inevitably tied to <strong>Boy</strong> in terms of sound and style. But in this one, they're trying to grow, in pretty much every way imaginably. Steve Lilywhite is still producing it, so you still have the big, echoey, dense sound. And here, when it's dense and big, it's <em>very</em> dense and big; and when it's not, it ranges from airy and plaintive, to upbeat and shiny, or whatever you wish. The diversity goes to the point of including a piano ballad (the title track) and bagpipes on an otherwise normal rock song ('Tomorrow'). "So what?" I hear some say, "many other bands did much more exotic things than that". Yes, mister imaginary friend Soren Lorenson, but this is U2, who had just recorded <strong>Boy</strong> on the previous year. It's the same band, the same guys, but they suddenly feel like they had important things to say; pretty much confirming the lyrics to 'The Ocean', released on the previous album.</p>

<p>And what is that thing to say? Religion! God! Christianity! Though delivered in a MUCH more understated manner than what we've become used to hear. Yes, of course Bono has a couple of moments of Leonardo di Caprio "I'm the king of the world" yelling loudly on some songs, when he goes "JEEEEERUUUUUUSAAAAAAALEEEEEEEEM", or "I'll REEEEEEEEEJOICE", or "GLOOOOOOOOORIA", but this stuff is really humble, as a personal discovery of God, or something. Whatever. All the kiddie themes are gone, but the sound remains in certain places. And the songs, <em>at times</em> give that smell of "sophomore slump", like little things that really missed in order to make the songs complete. But those moments are relatively rare. Overall, most songs are very good, which makes this a very worthwhile album, and not at all deserving of being "overlooked". The lack of immediate hits, in my opinion, doesn't reflect the album's lack of good songs.</p>

<p>Yes, of course it looks weaker in the shadow of <strong>Boy</strong>, but that's mainly due to the lack of the novelty aspect. The songs give a very decent continuation in terms of quality. The opener, 'Gloria', is the big classic of the record. And though it isn't as strong as the best songs from <strong>Boy</strong> in terms of melody, the band's performance is classic - giving little solo spots both to The Edge and Adam Clayton - and the finale, with the Latin chant being sung in harmony, puts a very grandiose, though still adequate closure to it. The playing style is very, very reminescent of the likes of 'I Will Follow' and 'Out Of Control', and the same happens with pretty much all the faster songs here, like 'Rejoice' and 'With A Shout', but the music is catchy enough to satisfy. 'Rejoice', in particular, has a classic, tingly guitar melody, and 'With A Shout' has a really cool, syncopated drum stomping by Larry Mullen at times.</p>

<p>Other good songs include 'Fire', that sounds like a more grandiose update on the 'A Day Without Me' rhythm, and for some reason, I really dig 'Stranger In A Strange Land', with its darker verses contrasting with the loud, fierce drum rushes. Melodically, it's pretty weak, but I like the mood it casts, combined with the lyrics. It's not quite a ballad, but it gets somewhat close. The other quieter songs here are also very good; 'I Fall Down' is one of my favourites, with very beautiful, rather subtle arrangements for piano and acoustic guitar, and Bono's inspired vocal delivery. 'October' is nearly a piano solo, with just a few sung verses near the end, and the piano part is very elegant, very sweet and nicely played. It does little to go beyond the state of "quiet intermission" in the album, but it's a good song. And 'Tomorrow', with the gradual build from Irish-folk-like intro to an all-out rock song, is pretty fabulous, too.</p>

<p>There are rather few weak songs here. 'I Threw A Brick Through A Window' begins promising enough, with a cool drum beat and a cachy guitar line, but it turns out to plod on and on for too long, without any really good hooks, and the performance isn't very exciting. Sounds really like filler. 'Scarlet' is almost an instrumental, with a quiet bass melody and loud drum stomping, and gentle arrangements for guitar and piano, but it sounds a bit too, um, full of itself? I dunno, I think the "Re-JOOOOOO-OOOOO-OOOICE" chants make it all a bit too obvious, and maybe even cheesy. It's not bad, though. And it could have been a decent ending to the album, but someone felt they needed to leave with a bang,so they contrived the unremarkable 'Is That All?', reusing a guitar riff from an earlier song. It really doesn't go anywhere, and it's just there so that the album ends with a fast rock song. It could have been better, but hey, for a band like U2, this is a quite brilliant sophomore slump. There isn't really that urgent feeling of "lack of material"; there are enough good songs to make the album worth having, at least for those who are really fond of U2's earliest stages. To be honest, I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone. It's not essential for the casual fan, though it has a couple of very, very good songs. You'd have to get a bootleg if you want to skip this.</p>

  Best song: <big>New Years' Day</big>
</p>

</div>

  <li><span class="good">Sunday Bloody Sunday ++</span></li>

<p>One of their most famous albums ever, this one. And it's easy to see why; 'Gloria' and 'The Electric Co.' are absolutely nothing in terms of energy and power when put next to 'Sunday Bloody Sunday'. You see, when U2 decides to talk about war, conflicts and terrorism in general, they just don't have "a message" to deliver - they've got a whole bucketload of anger, confusion and fear to dump on us, and they do it with much, much gusto. Even though Bono's lyrics can't help being a tad preachy at times, the overall mood of the album is of, perhaps, fear of what has already happened and what's yet to come. It's like a very personal, but very powerful cry of "what the fuck is going on?!" instead of "No more! No more!", like it would happen in the future.</p>

<p>The sound has also changed considerably, though Steve Lilywhite is still firmly with the production duties. Instead of the "dark, long tunnel" sound of the two previous albums, the guitar delay is diminished, leaving a very blatant, up-front, crushing sound, combined with the stomping rhythm section. The fast paced rhythms are also almost abandoned, in favour of militaristic, pounding rhythms. There are problems with this record though, and those problems really stop me from enjoying the album as much as some fans seem to do. Yes, it's a powerful album, and causes a very strong impression, at least on first listens. But subsequent listens seemed to scrape off that layers of "WOWness" from the album, revealing a rather thin layer of music - exactly the way you'd scrape off the pretty words from this review and reveal a very thin layer of dumb metaphors. Some of the music is a little disappointing, but the album saves itself from collapsing under its own weight by a couple of excellent songs and another couple of good ones as well. The two hits of the album, namely 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' and 'New Year's Day', are both excellent in their own, quite different ways. The former kicks in with the heaviest sound U2 could possibly assemble. Larry Mullen's drum pattern is almost universally recognisable, in which he simply alternates the hi-hat with the snare while mantaining the same sixteenth-note pace, and the constant kick drum pumping. And on top of that, the bass, guitar, electric violin, screaming vocals and backup voices are piled on top of them. The result is a monster, but spiced with a really, really catchy melody; a winning combination that yields one of the most memorable and successful U2 songs ever.</p>

<p>I prefer the more sophisticated 'New Year's Day', though, which smartly exchanges "rawness" for "subtlety", and thus instead of lowering the level of energy in the album, keeps it very steady and varied (especially when 'Seconds' almost sounds like a coda to 'Sunday Bloody Sunday', same tempo, drum pattern and all). The sound here is <em>very</em> gloomy,with Clayton's bass on the very center, and coupled with very simple, but awesome piano playing by The Edge. In fact, isn't that six note piano theme the thing that truly <em>makes</em> the song? Not that the composition itself is worthless, but the piano truly raises it from the state of "cool single" into "classic", almost singlehandedly. Yep, Bono's singing and lyrics are very evocative, too, and Edge even plays an economic but memorable guitar solo. Oh, yes, and the version on the album is different from the single version you can find in the 1980-1990 compilation, which had a couple of small bits removed, and the ending completely altered, to reduce the running length. Those two tracks are easy stand-outs, but there are other great ones. The other single, the poppy 'Two Hearts Beat As One', benefits from a really catchy melody, crossed over with love lyrics and a performance that actually continues the anger from side A. Eh? Even love songs need to be punchy and raw, too? Well, it's certainly pretty authentic, and carries the identity of the album without sounding inadequate. And I really, really like the often maligned 'The Refugee', which does set itself slightly apart with the others, with a swinged, almost danceable rhythm, punctured by percussion, a jumpy bass line and punchy backing vocals going "Woah, Wo-oah" in the chorus as if their lives depended on it. And I really, really like the effect casted by the "dreamy" atmosphere of the song telling the sad tale of a refugee fleeing from her home country ("Her mama says, one day, she's gonna live in America" somehow strikes me as a magnificent line).</p>

<p>The weaker songs, at least most of them, <em>do</em> suffer from their own weight. 'Like A Song', for example, is raging, fuming and fast, though it adds very, very few to the album in terms of melody. The instrumental coda is pretty cool, but this song also makes me wonder just <em>why</em> Bono needs to repeat the "sing this song" trick so often: it's in 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' ("How long must we sing this song?"), here ("Like a song I have to sing, I sing it for you"), on 'Surrender' ("Papa, sing my sing my sing my song") and on '"40"' ("How long to sing this song?"... hmm, d&eacute;j&agrave; vu?), though of course, that's as vain as complaining about Paul McCartney's lyrics on early Beatles songs. But still, makes me wonder. So, yes, 'Like A Song' is a bit weak, and the religious ballad 'Drowning Man' also overdoes the screaming, orchestral arrangements and "stormy" arrangement, in my opinion. 'Seconds' is better, with Edge's vocal debut and much catchier melodic content.</p>

<p>Side B keeps on sidestepping the formula that side A creates, with songs like 'Red Light' and 'Surrender', marked by lyrical references to prostitution, groovy, syncopated rhythms and a looser mood. The former is a bit annoying, with those repetitive lines, but it boosts an energetic performance and a very well placed, very well performed trumpet solo.'Surrender' is magnificent, though, with its slower tempo making a great contrast with the rest of the album. The vocals, the guitar and the rhythm section make a truly brilliant crescendo through the song up to a "choral" finale. The album ends on a religious note with the short '"40"' (stands for the 40th Psalm), a very pretty tune with the bass carrying the main riff. Just those lyrics in the chorus are a minor nuisance - didn't Bono have more inventive lyrics in store, anyway? Oh, of course it doesn't make the song worse, and it closes the album in a nice, surprisingly anti-climactic way (which almost became a clich&eacute; for the band). Yes, the album's angry mood is pretty much spilled over the entire album, but the songs are varied <em>enough</em> to push the album away from sameyness. It's just fairly inconsistent, in the end, which makes it a wee bit worse than <strong>October</strong>, in my opinion, and absolutely, completely far from touching <strong>Boy</strong>. But it's a classic in its own right, and a good introduction to U2 - and the last place to find some of that RAWK U2 love to say they do.</p>

<p>Steve Lilywhite is out of the production duties, and none other than Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno come in to replace them. And to this day, there are still some rabid Eno fans who <em>can't believe</em> how Eno DARED to work for such a pitiful, commercial, radio-friendly band as U2, and the most desperate excuse they could have come with is that he needed the money (yeah, sure, gotta keep in mind that <em>nobody</em> wanted Eno to work for them back then!). Well, what can I say? Eno &amp; Lanois are here, and not only seem to be quite happy with them, but would go on working with the band for more than two decades. Happy? H-h-h-ha-ha-h-h.</p>

<p>Well, the change of producers really caused a pretty great change in sound for the band, but you also have to give it to the change in songwriting. U2 are diversifying their rhythms and moods here, writing softer melodies as well as very rough ones. In short, I believe that Eno and Lanois were almost necessary to develop those nuances in their sound. And bottom line is that, well, this record <em>is</em> very different in sound and mood from <strong>War</strong>. There's basically nothing here that you can pick up as a direct extension of the material on the previous three albums - the closest to that is the heaviest song here, 'Wire', that <em>does</em> share some of the anger from the previous LP, but the melody is more impredictable, the guitar work is much more raw and noisy, and the production strips the music bare, exposing the grumbling bass, the scratching guitar and the lightning-speed drums barebones to the listener. No more is the claustrophobia reverb; this is music that hits you in the face.</p>

<p>In other tracks, yes, the reverbedness comes back, but the "shades" of the sound are different. The soft, pad-like synthesized chords Eno adds help illustrate that. The soft pads on the first two tracks and on 'Bad', for example, do seem to gather a lot from Eno and Lanois's ambient style, and the reverb serves more to soothe down the edges on the sound, instead of lifting it to the level of "GOD SPEAKS TO YOU FROM ABOVE", e.g. 'Rejoice'. So, yes, there's a certain blurriness in the music, as if it were painted with light brush strokes rather than throwing buckets of paint on the canvas. Call it atmospheric, if you wish. It probably is. I'll just be a dork and call it "evocative". ANd yes, it's my favourite U2 album, exactly because the mood it creates is very palpable and solid, and because the songs are all pretty great. Yes, some here are very different from what you'd traditionally call "songs", but hey, that's Eno/Lanois for ya.</p>

<p>Side A is fantastic in its own right, and rivals side A from <strong>Boy</strong> in terms of excellence and cohesion. It's got two pretty big hits - okay, two GREAT hits, though the title track isn't really that much of a best seller, but it's a very, very unique song for U2 at this point of their carreer, and possibly ever. Underpinned with lush orchestral arrangements, soft synth embellishments and a vague, but catchy melody. Notice the use of Edge's short guitar lines, which seem to fade slowly into the infinite. The other hit is the monumental 'Pride', which isn't really "monumental" in terms of songwriting, but in the grandiosity it achieved through wit and strength. The song is memorable from beginning to end, in every single little corner, even though it's not more than a proverbial "Pop Song&trade;". But its ringing guitar chords, the mechanical snare drum fills, the syncopated tom hits, all the little calculated guitar lines and, of course, Bono's passionate vocal delivery, especially on the &uuml;ber-catchy chorus. It's a classic in all respects, and still fits in flawlessly with the rest of the material. The other songs here are quite spectacular, in their own rights, too. 'Wire' is quite possibly one of the heaviest songs U2 ever made (along with the likes of 'Bullet The Blue Sky'), and 'A Sort Of Homecoming' is just gorgeous, with its "running" drum pattern countered by a lovely melody, which is nicely and cleverly developed through the song. The atmosphere here is great, indeed, and this is easily one of the most beautiful songs U2 ever made. The album closes with the short, but very sweet ballad 'Promenade'.It's pretty much an ideal closer, setting something of a "breather" right after such a big amoung of great music coming your way.</p>

<p>Side B doesn't really "pick up steam", though, as one could expect. And yes, well, it's a relatively weak B side - not because of the songs themselves, but mostly because of the structure. Instead of developing extremely great material like on side A, this side seems to focus on the sound, getting even pretty bold in some tracks. For example, 'Elvis Presley And America' is a six minute droning piece based on the slowed down backing track of 'A Sort Of Homecoming', with Bono singing improvised lines on top. Yes, and if you're wondering, there <em>is</em> "it was Brian Eno's idea!" written all over it, that is, to actually put the song in the album. The song has a very eerie, yet soothing, spontaneous vibe. It's long, really long, yes, but that's something you'll have to live with. '4th Of July', on the other hand, is much shorter, and much more minimalistic - a bass and guitar mood piece, with a droning bass line and sliding guitar notes everywhere. And 'MLK' (yes, stands for Martin Luther King, Jr., who is also the main subject of 'Pride') is Bono's "lullaby", based on a monotonous droning synth backing, which changes chords less than eight times through its course. It's a very pretty melody, indeed, though it puzzles me a bit why this would become a staple of their live shows.</p>

<p>Oh, well, anyway, this album also has my favourite U2 song ever. It's 'Bad', of course, a song that marries precise, clever production with a mantraic, hypnotic guitar line, a gradual building of tension and simple but memorable vocal melodies. A very simple formula yields really great results, one of U2's defining moments. The live renditions of this song are generally wildly lauded (such as the 12 minute long performance from Live Aid), but I'm a great, great fan of the more subtle, gradual album version. 'Indian Summer Sky' is the most "average" sounding thing here, a fast rock song which is quite unremarkable, standing in the shadows of 'Bad' and 'Wire', for example, but is very good and catchy, anyway. The different melodies incorporated in the song are all very good, and only the production seems a bit sketchy, though I can't really point out why. It's a great "hidden gem", though. And no, I don't think there's any weak link, or any "duffer" here. I still have a very soft spot for it, since it was the very first vinyl record I bought (in '01!); the outer sleeve is missing (damn, I love that castle image!), the inlay is really punished, but I almost wore out the LP the day I bought it. Hee hee, I like it so much. Yes, this and <strong>Boy</strong> are my indisputable U2 favourites, and you might corrrectly guess that it's downhill from here.</p>

<p>I didn't point out in the previous review, but <strong>The Unforgettable Fire</strong> had many references to the USA. 4th of July, Elvis Presley and America, and all. Well, this is an interest that only grew with time, and culminated on a monster (read further). <strong>The Joshua Tree</strong>, now, shows influence from the <em>music</em> of the US, that is, Blues, Southern rock, and such - though the most cynical will call it "immitations" instead. Well, in part, they are right. After all, the album never makes it quite clear what U2 is trying to <em>do</em> with those influences. Is it criticism, praise, or just "coolness"? Or an attempt at expanding their audiences overseas? Who the hell knows. All I know is that, yes, <strong>The Joshua Tree</strong> is to this day their biggest commercial breakthrough, and one of THOSE defining 80's albums. You can use this as a good example that the decade wasn't all that rotten (though some despise U2 so much that they would do <em>the opposite</em>).</p>

<p>And you can sort of see that this was intended to be a commercial breakthrough: the album begins with <em>three hit singles on a row</em>. I don't know about you, but if I were to structure an <em>album</em> proper, I'd try to keep things somewhat balanced. But, well, if it worked for <strong>The Joshua Tree</strong>, who am I to complain? Yes, 'Where The Streets Have No Name' is a downright fabulous opener, with Eno's keyboards put to absolutely full use in the slow, gradual intro, particularly when they're joined by Edge's now trademark ringing delayed guitar. And then, the song takes off into a pumping, tense and beautiful rocker with a "tension mounting" process similar to that of 'Bad' (it's not the only song here to do that). What I particularly like in the song is its "anthemic" vibe, which doesn't really invite the whole world to sing along - that is, it isn't based on a hook or a catchy melody, but on a well constructed and developed melody. 'I'm Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For' is the opposite, built on very simple, instantly memorable hooks. And though, yes, there's that classic "grandiosity" to it, it's still a quite phenomenal song. And you ought to agree that the melody is gorgeous, so yes. There.</p>

<p>One other important aspect of the album is the production. Very contrary to <strong>The Unforgettable Fire</strong>, it is give a very, very sharp, no-nonsense sound. The pads and synths are still somewhat prominent, but the spotlight is put on the guitars, which are sometimes crunchy and punchy, but most of the times just deliver that echoing "ring". But the whole band is given some sparkle in the record. It really sounds like Eno and Lanois put a lot of effort in making the album as "clean" as possible, and yes, it works. I have nothing against records that sound "clean", though I'm an adorer of the muddy feel of <strong>Boy</strong> and the "impressionism" of <strong>The Unforgettable Fire</strong>. Yes, it smells of "commercialism", but hey, U2 <em>are</em> a commercial band. Okay, they <em>became</em> a commercial band, but a very good and skillful one. "Artistic masterpieces" are more accidental than anything else, and that's what makes <strong>The Unforgettable Fire</strong> so special. <strong>The Joshua Tree</strong> is a conscious attempt at producing accessible, catchy music - in a way, didn't the Beatles do exactly that most of the time? No, U2 aren't the Beatles, but they make pop music anyway. GOOD pop music, mind. An example is 'With Or Without You', essentially a simple love ballad, but a gorgeous, well crafted and touching love ballad. The ascending melody and arrangement which leads to a climactic explosion, the droning rhythm which becomes more and more "human" (and U2 like, with Larry's syncopations) and Edge's processed guitar lines are some elements which contribute to make the song so special. Ain't it one of the greatest love songs ever? Or of the 80's, if you wish? Way better than 'All I Want Is You' for me, at least. And keep in mind that this was a time when Bono could bellow "I can't live with or without you" and make you FEEL it within you.</p>

<p>But there are more great songs other than the "holy trinity" in here. My favourite has always been the strong, biting, poignant 'Red Hill Mining Town', a hit single that never was. This one takes a fairly bluesy rhythm, and a strong, yet gentle arrangement with strings joining in, soft backing vocals and all. The great delight is the vocal melodies - somewhat vague but memorable. 'One Tree Hill' is another minor classic, with a lighter, airier arrangement. The focus is given to the guitar (with that brilliantly simple but awesome two note riff), and there's little bottom end to the song, producing a nice, "flying" mood that's not very common for U2. And the melodies are, of course, top notch, in spite of the radically simplistic chord progressions. In fact, there are very few places in which the melodies leave anything to be desired. 'Exit' is a kind of lacklustre rocker, featuring good dynamic changes and contrasts, but little actual musical material to speak of. 'Bullet The Blue Sky' is a bit of an exception, in which the melody steps out of the spotlight, leaving the focus on the tight, powerful band work, which gives a song which is like a "slow" counterpart of 'Wire', albeit with more strength and a more polished production. Larry's drum pattern is great, too. And, of course, there's Bono's piercing falsetto in the chorus and a great solo by the Edge. Pure class.</p>

<p>The weak tracks here are a minority, 'Trip Through Your Wires' is the first example of U2 trying to do a straight immitation of rock from "America", that is, Southern rock. It sounds a bit like an "omg america is soo KEWL" effort, and there isn't anything truly memorable about it, and 'In God's Country' is no more than a short, inoffensive but maybe too sugary (Edge's ultra-high-pitched guitar strumming gets on my nerves at times) pop ditty. It's just two songs, though, that boggle down side B a little but not the album as a whole. Of course this gives me a good excuse to rate it lower than <strong>Boy</strong>, but they're nothing terrible. I'm still a fan of the bluesy, gentle ballad 'Running To Stand Still' and the solemn, grave 'Mothers Of The Disappeared' - that bass riff even feels like something Mogwai would use in a song, and come to think of it, the dynamics thing on 'Exit' aren't far at all from the classic Mogwai thingamajik. Who would ever guess? Mogwai getting their cues from U2? Or a case of brilliant minds thinking alike? Hm, well. I think I managed to anger 80% of the Mogwai fandom here, so yes, Mogwai sucks. Oh, wait... I <em>like</em> Mogwai... and I <em>like</em> U2. Huh, I had almost forgotten. This thing of having to join the chorus of opinions in order to sound cool confuses me at times.</p>

<p>This is a relatively overlooked item in U2's catalog. And that's a shame, because this is a very, very important item. Why? Because listening to this, you'll realise that the sudden "change" into the 90's U2 wasn't such an unexpected thing. In fact, it becomes an almost obvious move. This mammoth of a double album is a "compendium" of U2's adventures in the US (or America, if you're willing to reduce an entire continent to one lousy country), and portraits the band's sudden obsession with all things related somehow to Blues and stuff. And yes, <em>more</em> than <strong>The Joshua Tree</strong> already was. Much more. And in fact, this album managed to compile another annoying aspect of the band: their sweeping, politically charged live concerts, filled with infamous quotes such as "This is a song Charles Manson stole from the Beatles. We're stealing it back" ('Helter Skelter', of course). So, yes, you've got Blues immitations, bootlicking references to the US National Anthem and artists like Jimi Hendrix and Bob Dylan, AND the bombastic live performances, all packed together in what sounds like the Most Important Statement in the World, emitted by the Most Important Band in the World. Yeech.</p>

<p>The album isn't all THAT BAD. But yes, there's <em>a lot</em> of stuff here that I ultimately don't care the least about, and a lot of stuff that I could <em>easily</em> live without. A couple of the songs are great, though, but in my opinion, the good stuff doesn't even amount to a single LP. I'm talking mainly about the studio efforts, that is. The live renditions are relatively weaker than their studio counterparts. Yes, I mean it! 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For', in its studio version, wasn't the most subtle thing ever, but at least it didn't boast Gospel choirs and "soulful" Bono grunting. <em>And</em> didn't go up to 6 minutes of self-licking. 'Pride (In The Name Of Love)' doesn't suffer too much, but of course, I can't help but prefer the more soothing album version, without audience participation.'Bullet The Blue Sky' seems to be the best live version, not losing much of its original power, and just gaining a goofy routine by Bono at the end.</p>

<p>There are three live cuts here, however, that weren't available on previous U2 albums: two covers and a B-side, 'Silver And Gold', which is a pretty cool Blues rocker, both in its studio version and here ("Okay, Edge, play the Blues" is something I didn't need to hear, though). As for the covers, well, 'Helter Skelter' is nothing. I don't know, maybe Bono felt so much importance on the lyrics that he didn't just openly SCREAM them into the mic, like ol' McCartney did on the White Album, and the band overall sounds like they didn't want to scare the audience. 'All Along The Watchtower',for one, laid aside that cool rhythmic ambiguity (the kings of syncopation, eh?), and in the hands of U2, it becomes Just Another Song&trade;. And what's with the quoting of the six first notes of The Star Spangled Banner at the end? Unnecessary at the very least, especially considering that a snippet of Jimi's own performance of it is already present near the end of the album.</p>

<p>The studio cuts... well, most of them are pretty Bluesy - not necessarily in essence. 'Desire' was one of U2's most successful singles, with a Bo Diddley beat, a catchy three chord riff and all. It's a fun song and all, but doesn't <em>really</em> hit the jackpot to me. Others are considerably less worthwhile. 'When Love Comes To Town' features B.B. King, and his presence is always good, but... Ehhhh. And 'Love Rescue Me' features Bob Dylan of all people, but it just plods on and on with its slow, religious "sweeping" six minutes of Bluesness. The inviting of the guest musicians may have been a honest attempt at paying homage to them, but you know, they end up sounding like U2 trying to attract more audiences. The best song here, for me, is 'Angel Of Harlem', a joyful, passionate song devoted to Billie Holliday. It's upbeat and has a fun horn section, so there! You know, nice stuff. I'm also somewhat a fan of the more romantic songs, like the grandiose, but cool 'Hawkmoon 269', with Bono saying he "needs your love" about 97 times, but with the band performance creating a cool effect. And 'All I Want Is You' is "spiced" with a bombastic, climactic ending and a strings section playing a long, bluesy coda to it. But it's a great, great melody, and that's what matters in the end.</p>

<p>One thing that annoys me a lot here (though it's not the first place you can hear this) is that Bono always has to end his spoken phrases with that strong breathing noise of his ("Who RUNNNNhhhhhuh, into the armshhhhhhuh... ... of Americahhhhhhhhhuh"). But yes, of course, there's a lot more to it than that. Overall, the album's excesses ended up backfiring on the band, and they had to "dream it all up again". And their musical path headed in the direction more or less pointed at by 'Heartland' and 'God, Pt. 2' (a sequel of sorts to John Lennon's 'God' - can you believe that?). You'll just see what I mean on the next review.</p>

<p>So, yes, U2's stylistic change now is pretty much fully explained. And what change is that? Well, they decided to fully adopt 90's pop as their style, though still saying they always were and will always be a rock 'n' roll band. Yes, there <em>is</em> a clear rock influence in many of these songs, but they rarely deviate from the formula of rhythm driven, groovy 90's dance pop and such. The melody department, though, seems to be pretty dry here. Too often, the band depends <em>too much</em> on the rhythm and on the polished, hip production. Disturbingly enough, even though Eno and Lanois are still the masters of the sound here, the production sounds quite sterile and flat. Almost like they didn't want to scare their audiences <em>again</em>. Heck, <strong>The Josuha Tree</strong>, "clean" as it was, had a much punchier, crunchier sound. <strong>Achtung Baby</strong> sounds like the band playing outside your closed bedroom door, and maybe with a few pillows on the loudspeakers. I initially thought it was result of the limited sound of the record player, but no, it isn't.</p>

<p>So, the album is a slight mishmash of great songs and overproduced fluff. Yes, there <em>are</em> stand-outs here that keep the album worth listening. But let's get the fluff outta the way first, shall we? I have to admit that, for a long time, I really had a lot against this record. It took some time to truly tell <em>what</em> was wrong with the record and what was right. And I say, it's really not bad at all. There's just too much stuff that seems to test my nerves, you know. The trio of opening tracks couldn't have been more flaccid, to be very honest. Yes, and I'm talking about three <em>hits</em> for the band, but I just find nothing in them to write home about. 'Zoo Station' and 'Even Better Than The Real Thing' are based more or less on the same rhythm, and are both on the same key. I wouldn't doubt that there's an attempt at "continuity" between those songs (I remember reading that the guitar sound at the start of the second track immitates a sound commonly heard on Dublin subway stations, so this might be indeed a direct link from 'Zoo Station'), but yeah, they're pretty much the same, and none have a really, truly catchy hook; only pretend to. I won't say that the rhythm and band work aren't energetic and exciting and all, but that only prevents the songs from being a <em>total</em> bore. As for 'One', a "sweeping" ballad which employs that good old slow crescendo of instruments, never really captures me, either. <em>Melody</em>, dammit. Is that too much to ask?</p>

<p>The thing that catches me, though, is that several songs I like here don't have really powerful hooks, either. Off the top of my head, I can name <em>very few</em> melodies that really stand out. One of them is in the chorus of 'Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses', a romantic tune that's quite unusual for U2. I mean, a song with lyrics like these would have been a highly unlikely inclusion on <strong>The Joshua Tree</strong>; not that this is a complaint, mind. The song itself is quite pretty and rather pleasant, though it <em>does</em> get syrupy at times. Another good melody is on the brilliant 'So Cruel', which creates a tension that's simply unexplainable. I dare say not even 'With Or Without You' was so successful, especially since 'So Cruel' seems to never be quite resolved. And the chorus, yes, has that great falsetto melody, and good uses of strings and piano. Very good stuff. The situation changes on 'Until The End Of The World', in which the magic seems to reside on the band work. Instead of the attempt at a joyful, jumpy, light atmosphere of the first tracks, this one is pretty dark and moody, and the one-chord guitar riff <em>is</em> catchy in a way. Maybe it's the production style that seems to enhance the overall mood of the song, while it boggles down the first songs. It <em>is</em> rather muddy, indeed.</p>

<p>"Dark and moody" makes its return on the side B opener, 'The Fly'. The funky guitar riff, the groovy bass and the chorus with both Bono and the Edge singing different lines makes this pretty memorable. The two final tracks dump the "groovy" dance sounds in favour of... um, something else. 'Acrobat' is closer to their 80's rocking sound, though the production does seem to create quite a mess of the instruments. But still, it rocks, and I just really like Bono's vocal delivery and the tense band work. 'Love Is Blindness', on the other hand, is the closest to a funeral dirge that U2 ever made, and it <em>is</em> very beautiful, very sombre, and the climax at the end improves matters quite a bit. And I like it also because of how it contrasts with the rest of the album. This is a most unexpected ending. 'Ultraviolet' is another favourite of mine, a song which crosses the usual fast rhythm with a more romantic, emotional message. It's very beautifully performed.</p>

<p>You know, when you think of it, the album's quite a mixed bag: the production works wonders on some tracks, while it makes others sound like a plastic blob; some songs aren't catchy but work, yet others are very catchy, in definition, but dom't quite stand the heat from stronger tracks ('Mysterious Ways', which boasts a highly funky rhythm and a great chorus, yet sounds a bit weak). Oh, yes, and by this time, Bono was starting to feel like, anytime he needed to fill up the lyrics in some way, he could just chant the word "love" as if it meant the whole world on its own. I know that love means a lot in his philosophy, but hey, did you ever try repeating a single word several times, either vocally or mentally, until the whole meaning of the song disappeared and you were only left with the ugly sound of it? Yep, that's just it. Overall, I wouldn't be quite fair if I said <strong>Achtung Baby</strong> is worthless. Yes, there are some pretty worthless spots ('Trying To Throw Your Arms Around The World', which is slow, long, uncatchy and has an annoying guitar sound which pops up every 3 seconds), but some excellent spots as well. This is mandatory for U2 fans, but this might turn into a bomb for those who already have something or two against the band. Be warned.</p>

<p>Groan, my friends. Now that U2 has picked up on the "dance pop" direction, they felt the need to puff up their sound with hip, crazy synthesizers, samples and sound effects, as well as wipe the guitar out almost completely from some songs. Why? I have no idea. This was probably their idea of how to get "up to date". All I know is that, as far as Electronica is concerned, this is far from Autechre or Aphex Twin. This is... you know, noise not used for an actual purpose, but because it <em>has to be</em> used. The result is a production that sounds really forced and contrived. And yes, Brian Eno is involved with the production, though he's joined by Flood, here. Does that make any difference? No idea.</p>

<p>The problem, now, isn't really with the production. In fact, such kinds of sound <em>might</em> work if there's a specific point to be made, or if the songs accomodate them... Yes, you can guess why I'm definitely not a fan of this record. Not <em>all</em> of the songs are a let-down, but several of them are, and are BIG let-downs. Those songs are awfully sterile, uninteresting and just overall lacking on the songwriting department. They sound merely thrown together for the sake of filling up the album, and thinking that the machines can finish the songs all by themselves. Take 'Some Days Are Better Than Others', for example. The lyrics are awfully inane (though this isn't a rule for the whole album, fortunately), and the whole song is pretty much based on a single bass line. It's a nice bass line, but why should it singlehandedly carry a song like this? Or better, should it do that and <em>succeed</em>? Judging by this song, I wouldn't say so. It's not catchy - okay, it <em>is</em> catchy in a dumb sort of way, but all the synthetic arrangements just make it sound stupider than it could have been.</p>

<p>Likewise, other songs just pass me by completely, like it's the case of the incredibly bland ballad 'Babyface'. It even manages to sound like some obscure B-side recycled to fill up an empty slot on the album. This also seems to be the case of 'Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car', an unmemorable dance monster which doesn't even have anything to show aside from all the electronic, sonic trash. There are exceptions, like I said, since not all tracks are dismissable. The title track does manage to be quite entertaining, especially in the slow first part, with the lyrics consisted of advertising slogans. As for 'Lemon', it's a very beautiful, eerie ballad in its essence. And for one, the claustrophobic dance arrangement works in its favour, giving it something of a bitter irony. And it also helps that the arrangement is very minimalistic, including not much more than the usual drums/bass groove, spacious synth chords and occasional piano and cello embellishments.</p>

<p>Moving to the ballads a little, 'Stay' is totally excellent, and in fact, one of the best songs U2 put out from the 90's on, in my opinion; so much better than 'One' it's not even worth talking about. The arrangement is mercifully pure and unobtrusive, and the melody is easily the best in the album. On the flipside, there's 'The First Time', and it sounds like a dumb, pale attempt at doing a "compact" 'All I Want Is You', retaining the pomposity, "heartache" guitar lines and the strings, and none of the melody. To say the least, it's <em>icky</em>, so much that it even fails as a "breather". For all I care, the electronic tunes don't sound so pompous. Edge's showcase, 'Numb', is more gimmicky than pompous, with its droning guitar riff, one-note melody and "listing" lyrics, and 'Dirty Day' plods along, once again relying entirely on a simplistic, nearly banal bass line. I have no problem with simplistic and banal lines per se, since bands can actually turn them into powerful, beautiful things (Mogwai, anyone?), but 'Dirty Day' presents nothing else! Bono's lyrics are all very obscure and intriguing, but I really lost my interest for Bono's lyrics around the time of <strong>Achtung Baby</strong>. Say, he really has a way with words, but <strong>Zooropa</strong> as a whole makes its point painfully obvious; what with the use of advertising and confusion of voices in the title track, the endless "don't this, don't that, don't anything" of 'Numb' and the anti-materialistic anthem of 'The Wanderer', that features none other than Johnny Cash on the vocals. The song is often kinda maligned, but I like it. It's very pretty, nicely written,and the performance is gentle enough to be an <em>actual</em> breather before the album ends. I won't say "oh, thank goodness Bono doesn't sing this", but yes, Cash does a brilliant job here. Overall, not a remarkable album, though, and one I'm not too hot on listening in its entirety. Amazingly, this is far from being U2's lowest point.</p>

<p>Ooh, the post-modern irony, the criticism of consummerism achieved through consummerism itself, yadda yadda yadda. Who would ever guess? What U2 really needed wasn't an electronic album: they needed a CONCEPTUAL electronic album. The concept, of course, is not much more than <em>"Modern life SUCKS"</em>, with rants about consummerism, futility, greed and all those things thousands of other artists have ranted about before in more subtle, smarter ways, and WITHOUT littering their songs with sounds much more "hip" and "gritty" than on <strong>Zooropa</strong>. A common observation on the album is that its recording and production were incredibly rushed, and it has a big, obvious negative effect on the album overall. But if you mind me, even though the production <em>is</em> obtrusive many times, the problem is - once again - with the actual songs. Even though the album has a good share of <em>good</em> songs, it has an awful lot of very annoying/irritating/dumb stuff, and the final package is very bogged down and unstable.</p>

<p>There's a minimal share of stuff that I really detest. But the stuff is really so passive and bland that even detesting it is a stretch. The only <em>real</em> pain here is 'Mofo', the band's true, unabashed attempt at techno - if that's what you call techno, after all, there are a dozen million subgenres of electronic music. In a few words: give me, I dunno, Squarepusher instead. The band has got <em>nothing</em> but a fuzzy bass riff in the entire song, and Bono goes on a complete rant about more of his personal troubles and his mother and stuff I can hardly care about. It's just the bass riff over and over again, and nothing at all that makes the song any better than all that ocean of generic techno trash we had to deal with during the 90's. At least in <em>that</em> kind of generic techno trash, we didn't have to deal with Bono's whining - which does reach a whole new level here. He did have his share of biting, truthful lyrics in the past, but <em>here</em>, he limits himself to stating the obvious in fancy, "poetic" ways. And this means that, oh, the album only has this modern sound for the irony of criticising exactly what it tries to immitate. As such, you're deprived from listening to actually <em>good</em> music because the album's too busy making an important statement! Ain't it, like, <em>awesome</em>?</p>

<p>Thing is, the music in the album isn't at all devoid of goodness. Many songs here are effectively <em>spoiled</em> by the obnoxious, saturated arrangements. So a song like 'Gone', which is good on the melody department, loses the power it would have if it were released on, say, <strong>Achtung Baby</strong>. Still, the chorus is one of those moments of unique glory that lifts you out of the sameyness... unfortunately to dunk you into dreck like 'Miami', in which Bono moans and raves about - you got it - Miami over a jagged, noisy drum track. As for the ballads 'The Playboy Mansion' and 'If God Will Send His Angels', they serve as merciful breaks in the album, but are nothing to write home about, and 'If You Wear That Velvet Dress' makes a really forgettable stab at an "eerie", anti-romantic tune. None of them reach the low of 'Mofo', fortunately, but that's not much of a compliment. Among the songs I like, well... There's the poppy 'Staring At The Sun', with one of the most inane sets of lyrics Bono ever commited. But, oh, it's so very catchy, especially that gluey guitar line the Edge pulls off every time the chorus rolls by. Other tracks like 'Last Night On Earth' and 'Do You Feel Loved' are awfully unremarkable but not worthless, presenting something like a neat bass line, or a guitar riff, or an effective atmosphere. Same happens with the anguished 'Please' and its cool, groovy drum pattern. It's a modestly good song, and you can even think of it as an almost dirge a la 'Love Is Blindness', though faster. And, damned I'll be, but I <em>like</em> 'Discot&egrave;que' more than a bit - if only because, at this point of the album, it's something of a fine novelty, and it's pretty catchy. Think about it: the song would be a classic if the band didn't go ahead and put much preachier, dreckier songs in the album. It would stand out a lot.</p>

<p>'Discot&egrave;que' stands to show that the album isn't entirely hopeless, but... Well, I don't have any use for it, taken as a whole. The concept of "starting at a party and ending in a funeral" (and it DOES end in quite a funeral, with the sombre, limp quasi-blues of 'Wake Up Dead Man') doesn't take me anywhere, and don't tell me I don't <em>understand</em> the concept: it's so banal that anyone can understand it. But it's that: banal. Post-pubescent teenagers might relate with the "snide" commentary of 'The Playboy Mansion', but I don't. I'm sorry, but I just wanted a bit of <em>music</em>, y'know?</p>

<p><big><big><big><big>WHAT THE FU--*BOOOOOOM*...</big></big></big></big></p>

<p>I'm serious; I can't find any more appropriate way to start the review for this album. It's just that: a letter bomb.You unassumingly pick it up, and you realise what it really is <em>just</em> when you don't have any time to throw it out of the window and run for cover. And what's the sad truth here? Simple: it's like the band found out that they were short on songs for their next album, so, verging on nervous breakdown, Bono went to the studio next door where N'Sync were recording their newest album and asked for some spare songs. And then he, of course, replaced the bubblegum lyrics with, um, inane bubblegum lyrics and turned them into hit singles. Don't call me a herectic: it's on the U2 auto-biography "Spiderman Goes to Broadway with Bono and the Edge: All the money will be donated to charity; we have enough money already, but there's no such thing as an over-inflated ego!".</p>

<p>Let's go slowly, now. For one, U2 dumped the techno trash, Flood, and whomever else was producing <strong>Pop</strong>, and went back to Eno 'n' Lanois. And even though they left 'Mofo' and 'Miami' and all that crap far behind, this is <em>NOT</em> the "return to their roots" that everyone in the world was yelling about back them. Tell me: <em>what roots</em>? <strong>Boy</strong> it certainly isn't. <strong>The Joshua Tree</strong> neither. It's not even <strong>Achtung Baby</strong>, for the music here is so fluffy, puffy, sterile and dull that it can't hope to compare even to songs like 'One'. To me, that "roots" thing was either an overreaction or an excellent marketing trick. Or both.But the truth it is not. If you want to be strict, you can just say that U2's roots are Post Punk, but you don't even need to go that far.</p>

<p>In short, this album can go to hell. You can see all over the album that the band was just trying to easiest ways towards recognition and chart topping; otherwise, what's the point of a song like 'Elevation'? Tuneless ooh-oooing (Bono's falsetto here is so out of shape that I think Christopher Walken would have done a better job), a dumb-as-hell guitar "riff", a hundred billion electronic noises dripping everywhere and the dumbest set of lyrics Bono ever dared to put on a song. Now you ask me, what the <em>fuck</em> is that thing doing in a U2 record? Easy: earning bucks. And so it did. The song opened virtually every U2 performance around that time, and you can just <em>visualise</em> it in your mind. Everything in the song is coldly calculated - even the tempo, intended to make the whole crowd jump along. Tell me I'm wrong, really! Tell me so and I'll tell you that the song was in the soundtrack for the goddamn <em>Tomb Raider movie</em>, and they were pretty much made for each other.</p>

<p>Fortunately, 'Elevation' is the only attempt the band does at sounding "hip" and "kickass" in the album. The other songs are just attempts at being "hip", and yes, most of them are lame. 'Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of' is a particularly icky-sticky attempt at a ballad, which at first is just mediocre, but becomes painfully "anthemic" as it grows. It can't even hope to be as awful as 'Peace On Earth': it sounds like Bono suddenly forgot that talking about an actual incident <em>is not</em> a good excuse to be ridiculously cheesy, <em>or</em> he never knew that but never showed it. Until now, that is. As a result, I can't listen to the song without becoming murderously irritated or embarrassed. Other songs aren't as offensive, but do little to improve my feelings towards the album: 'Kite', 'In A Little While' and 'Wild Honey', 'When I Look At The World' - all awfully generic and predictable. The former <em>does</em> feel quite genuine and emotive, and is one of the songs that I could say I like, here. It could be better if it weren't made to sound exactly like all the other songs from year 2000. I'm also not against 'New York' - as far as songs titled after North American cities, this is <em>so</em> much better than 'Miami' that I shouldn't even have mentioned it. It's an okayish, unsurprising yet catchy almost-rock song. And there's 'Walk On', which borders on bad taste several times (oh, GOODNESS, Bono - was that spoken word intro <em>really</em> necessary?), but Edge once again pulls off a memorable guitar line to lift the song from utter dullness. Oh, no, no, I don't like the song merely for one single guitar line - it's quite pretty, overall.</p>

<p>As for 'Beautiful Day', it <em>is</em> a perfectly good song, which for one boasts a <em>good</em> arrangement for keyboards and synths and whatnot, and creates a mighty fine dynamic between the "synth" parts and the "full band" ones. There's nothing to love about the main melody, and I still question the need for a generic slow break in the middle as if there was a law on that. It's a minor complaint, though, considering the song as a whole. I'm still not sure whether it justifies the whole album... No, it doesn't. It's a mediocre album - heck, worse than mediocre. <strong>Pop</strong> was mediocre. This is worse. Not <em>much</em> worse. Just worse. Considerably worse. Worse in a relevant way. Yep.</p>

<p>So, do you know what's the step after a band turns bad? Yes - it turns irrelevant. You see, I'm just speculating here, but maybe - <em>just maybe</em> - the realisation hit U2 that the thing of their "return to their roots" on <strong>All That You Can't Leave Behind</strong> was all a bag'o'shit, so they decided to do it the "right" way; yes, the "right" way. First, they brought back Steve Lilywhite for the production duties. This didn't stop them from keeping a horde of co-producers nearby, but ol' Steve is there, so that they can make the obvious association with their rock 'n' roll past. Second, almost all synthesizers have been wiped out from existance, and the Edge plays more guitar in this album alone than in his entire career until then. Third, they made set up a contract when Apple and wrote the biggest iPod anthem of all time, 'Vertigo'. Of course, since they were unable to <em>come up</em> with an actual riff for it, they just turned to an old Sonic Youth song as their source of inspiration. But, oh, the RAWKIN' guitars! The inane two-note verse melody! The mangled Spanish at the beginning - okay, so there's something of an explanation for that, since "one, two, three, fourteen" stands for the albums which Steve Lilywhite produced, or so Bono says. But who cares about what Bono says? Yes, he said that this is their very first rock album. By the way, did you ever hear that excellent Mambo record <strong>Boy</strong>? There's some mean Zydeco on <strong>War</strong>, too.</p>

<p>Okay, 'Vertigo' ain't all that bad, but heck, it's such an obviously cheap, attention-whoring attempt at an easy hit single that it's pretty nauseating, considering only the idea. Finally, though, we know jst <em>what it is</em> that Bono &amp; Co. defined as "rock" all this time. No, I don't hate the song, really. I just don't have any big feelings for it. In fact, I don't have big feelings for <em>most</em> songs here, and that's what I mean with "irrelevant". Most tracks here are easily-churned-out slabs o' commercialism disguised as sentimental and/or religious confessions. There are no standouts, no particularly remarkable songs, in short: nothing to write home about. Really: <em>nothing</em>. There isn't even anything especially awful or embarrassing to talk about. Every song here is a throwback to previous U2 successes (and failures) in some way. I wouldn't say all songs are direct rip-offs, but none of them bring <em>anything new</em>. There are a few, um, un-U2-like bits in the album, but that doesn't mean they particularly work. As an example, 'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own' has guitar parts that sound like the Edge had an obsession on The Cure's 'A Letter To Elise' (or on their <strong>Disintegration</strong>/<strong>Wish</strong> era in general), but the song overall is a pretty flaccid, puffed-up sentimental ballad. And 'Love And Peace Or Else', with its bluesy beat and fuzzed-out guitar riff, just chugs along all the way to nothingness.</p>

<p>The rest is... well. There are some okay songs here, but honestly, I don't think I'll find myself returning to those songs very often from here. 'City Of Blinding Lights' has that sickly "poignant" guitar riff, but it's catchy on spots, and 'All Because Of You' is an alright quasi-rocker. Among the ballads, 'A Man And A Woman' has a pretty nice Latin taste, though the song itself is hardly any remarkable.
