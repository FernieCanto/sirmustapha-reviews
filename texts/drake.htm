<p>How much is there to talk about this guy that hasn't been said before? Not
much, I think. I mean, you can find a decent story of his carreer in any page
that reviews him, and even on Wikipedia. The basic ideas is that the guy wasn't
exactly <em>famous</em> while he was alive. But way after his death, he became
quite a legend. I can't say <em>what</em> exactly did turn him into such a
legend (maybe it was the car commercial?), but he <em>was</em> bound to turn
into one, anyway - not much for his early death, or his "prediction" of his post
mortem success ('Fruit Tree'), but actually for his talent. His music is
<em>great</em>! Though it's hard to tell whether you will like it. See, in order
to enjoy his work as a whole, you have to really <em>care</em> about the guy,
and get into the specific state of mind to understand his music (and I'm not
sure whether I understand him at all). That doesn't mean you <em>won't</em>
enjoy it if you don't understand it.</p>

<p>Well, what's to say? He was a <em>fantastic</em> guitarist. Really. His
playing was focused in the acoustic, and most guitar experts rave all over Nick
Drake's guitar skills. But if you listen to some of his songs, you may not
really get what's so spectacular. That's because he wasn't a show-off! He never
used his skills to show off, but to actually contribute to the music. His odd
fingerpicking techniques, the guitar tunings, the dexterity and inventiveness,
pretty much everything contributed to make Nick Drake extract a very powerful
sound of his guitar. Maybe it's very clever sound engineering, but in his last
album, <strong>Pink Moon</strong>, one sole acoustic guitar track was enough to
give you the impression that a whole band was playing. It's pretty amazing. But
guitar skills aren't much if you don't have good songs - and Nick WAS a great
songwriter. His scope was fairly limited - folk and its whereabouts - and I
won't be so far from the truth if I say that all his songs, superficially, are
all the same. What truly made his three LP's so different from each other are
the arrangements and orchestrations (or the lack thereof), which weren't made by
him. There <em>is</em> a lot of credit to give to the guys that worked with
Nick, but most of his songs are <em>his</em> creations, so...</p>

<p>He sings like an old man. His voice is slightly worn out, though it ain't
hard to like it. He's no Bob Dylan, that's for sure. Overall, I think he's a
very, very likeable artist overall. It's just a bit of a challenge to truly
<em>get</em> into his music fully. But he has quite a bunch of fairly devoted
fans, so I guess his output <em>is</em> rewarding, after all.</p>

<p>Here, the formula hasn't been changed too drastically. There's still a little bit of goofy sci-fi (from 'Helpless Automaton' to 'Dr. Heckyll And Mr. Jive'), grim lyrical topics (from 'Touching The Untouchables' to 'Overkill'), parental affairs (from 'Be Good Johnny' to 'Settle Down My Boy'), Greg Ham's dorky goofiness (from 'Helpless Automaton' to 'I Like To')... Okay, okay, I'll stop. I don't want to make this album look like a carbon copy of their debut, since it's not. But it's true that the formula is more or less the same, but it only goes to show how much more the band had in stock. This album <em>is</em> a stepdown from <strong>Business As Usual</strong>, but I can't accuse them of anything. If they wanted to pull off an even bigger masterpiece, they would <em>have</em> to change. And either it wasn't the right time to change, or they just didn't want to. After all, when you still have a lot of great music to write, why throw it all on the trash just to "change"? Change doesn't necessarily mean artistic growth (and that goes to YOU, U2).</p>

<p>Step down or not, this album <em>is</em> a perfectly good purchase if you like <strong>Business As Usual</strong>. It's a wee bit longer, the production is a wee bit better, and the mood is also a wee bit different. There's not much of that goofy humour... Things are a bit darker here. But the album's still fun! Just listen to 'Dr. Heckyll &amp; Mr. Jive' and hear it for yourself - THAT is sci-fi humour at its best. And how could you go wrong with a title like that? It's not really the fun of hearing Colin Hay go "storyteller" on us: it's just amazing to hear all of those clever little riffs, the vocal melodies, the meticulous parts of the music falling <em>perfectly</em> in place.</p>

<p>Greatness keeps coming on the pop-reggae 'It's A Mistake', with polictical lyrical matters, and more of those priceless melodies Men At Work could do so well. 'Overkill' is plainly gorgeous, sad and almost desperate. Don't miss the equally catchy verse and chorus melodies and that guitar solo. 'Upstairs In My House' is another revelation... Wow, they can do those "fast ballads" really well. The "I like it UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPstairs in my house" chorus might raise some surprised eyebrows. Just hear for yourself what I mean when I talk about Hay's singing.</p>

<p>Maybe it's the time to voice my complaints? Well, there aren't many, really. I'd just say that this album's "epic", 'No Sign Of Yesterday', is only really inferior to 'Down By The Sea' because of the unnecessary synth "embellishments". Wipe them out, and the song gains the precious moodiness it really needs. The song itself is brilliant - it just could have been better, even if you can't improve that guitar picking and the vocal melodies. Complaint number two... Well, Greg Ham's 'I Like To' is one of the very few Men At Work songs that I really don't like. It's not for the song itself, but just because of the way he feels the need to pull off a David Byrne immitation to deliver those "wacky", "paranoid" lyrics with that bubbly voice. David could do much better than "I like to look at pictures in a book / never read the writing, just put it down / I like to". Heck, even Colin Hay himself did better in other songs in the album. The song also reminds me very much of what The Cure did to 'Foxy Lady' on their debut LP. The only noteworthy thing about the song is the instrumental break, though it isn't really <em>that</em> spectacular.</p>

<p>But the song doesn't really do much harm, since 'No Restrictions' comes right after it. And it's one of the very few Men At Work songs where the intro and the ending don't have anything to do at all with what's inbetween them. That means, don't be alarmed with the "dramatic" intro, since the song itself is fast and catchy. But I <em>do</em> have to voice another complaint, but this time against the <em>production</em>. Heck, why don't they just let the song <em>rock</em>? You can FEEL the drums and the bass trying to give the song some damn <em>drive</em>, but the guitars are all too sluggish. But the song itself? Goody. And if you want some <em>real</em> humour on the album, you can try Ron Strykert's first moment in the "spotlight", with 'Settle Down My Boy'. Such fun and catchy pop music! It shows Colin Hay wasn't really the only great songwriter in the band, also reminding that a couple of Men At Work songs are Hay/Strykert compositions. He has a fun voice, too. Ah, and how can I forget the fun 'High Wire', even though it isn't really <em>too</em> relevant? And 'Blue For You', with <em>VERY</em> sweet Reggae sounds, guitar chords and vocal melodies? It's probably the warmest, cutest song the band ever made. I like romantic songs when they are like <em>this</em>.</p>

<p>I really can't say something like <em>don't miss this album</em> this time around, you know. I still recommend <strong>Business As Usual</strong> first if you're not familar with the band. But after you get that one, do get this one, too. They go together very well. <strong>Cargo</strong> is good. It's even great. If you <em>do</em> see it somewhere, get it.</p>

<p>Oh, what an annoying thing to say. What am I doing here, reviews or advertising?</p>

<p>Argh! Aaargh! 1985! Kill! Kill!... Oh, wait... I was <em>born</em> in 1985. But, oh, jeebus. Isn't it enough to review one bland pop album from 1985 (<strong>Little Creatures</strong>, if you don't know), I have to review <em>another</em> one? Oh, so do I. Meh, but I can do it. Can we review it? Yes, we can!</p>

<p>So, what are we going to review today, Wendy? Oh, yes. Farmer Colin Pickles needs to have his band's album <strong>Two Hearts</strong> reviewed. Let's get going right away! *forgets his cellphone*</p>

<p>[cue instrumental version of the theme tune]</p>

<p>Good day, Farmer Colin Pickles!</p>

<p><em>Good day, Fernie. Good to see you here. You see, my band Men At Work had a few problems after <strong>Cargo</strong> was released, so me and Greg, the scarecrow, lost a few band members. And when we made our next album in 1985, we had to replace them with synthesizers.</em></p>

<p>Oh, I see. Well, I can see the production here has improved a little, in comparison with <strong>Cargo</strong> and <strong>Business As Usual</strong>. But there are a few too many synthesizers, indeed!</p>

<p><em>Yes, I know. We thought we'd use them because everybody was using them back then, but I didn't think it would sound so dated twenty years later.</em></p>

<p>Oh, don't worry, Farmer Hay! I've heard much more dated albums before. Mr. Oldfield's <strong>Tubular Bells II</strong>, from 1992, dated twice as fast as your album. But why did the band turn into this kind of commercial, radio-friendly synthesized pop? It sounds a bit faceless, doesn't it?</p>

<p><em>Faceless? Oh, yes, you're right, Fernie. It's just that since nobody had a face back in 1985, we thought they were obsolete.</em></p>

<p>I know. The eighties were tragic to a lot of people. But the album's main problem is that it's not too consistent. There are some great tracks here, like 'Man With Two Hearts' and the sweet and catchy 'Everything I Need'. And, oh, 'Maria' is gorgeous! The sitar gives it a special touch, but it would have been great even without it.</p>

<p><em>Thanks, Fern. We still had a couple of bottles of Inspiration back then, so we could make songs like that. Greg wrote 'Stay At Home', too, which is pretty fun. 'Giving Up' is quite pleasant, but I find it too generic...</em></p>

<p>[cue Greg, the Scarecrow's tune]</p>

<p><em><strong>Oooh, hello, Farmer Colin Pickles! Did I hear you say my name?</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Good morning, Greg. I was just talking about your songs from our album <strong>Two Hearts</strong>.</em></p>

<p>Yes, Greg, we were. I have to say that I like 'Stay At Home' a little bit more than 'I Like To', from <strong>Cargo</strong>, even if it lacks the full band performance and the rock guitars.</p>

<p><em><strong>Ooh, you think so? Huhuhuhuh! Thank you, Fern! Oh! Oh, and what did you think of my singing in 'Still Life'?</strong></em></p>

<p>Oh, it's good, Greg. The song is quite nice, with its sad atmosphere, though it isn't too memorable.</p>

<p><em>We thought we needed to make a dramatic, grim song like that one, but I guess it could have been worse. But anyway, Greg, weren't you supposed to be somewhere else, scaring birds?</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Yes, Farmer Hay. Sorry, Farmer Hay. Greg's on the job! Huhuhuhuh!</strong></em></p>

<p>Anyway, I really <em>do</em> think 'Giving Up' is a bit generic. But hey, it's better making openly pleasant and generic pop songs like 'Giving Up' than doing like Talking Heads and disguising your genericism with "goofiness". There isn't too much wackiness here, though I don't like that disco throwaway 'Sail To You'. Some of the tracks are quite sad, and I really like 'Children On Parade', but I don't care much about the two penultimate tracks...</p>

<p><em>Really? Oh, well, I guess albums like these always lose steam towards the end.</em></p>

<p>It's true, Farmer Hay. You know, the album isn't bad at all. It's nice, but I don't think people should try too hard to get it. It's a shame that the band didn't live up to the two first albums, and that none of these songs became really successful. I really like your band, you know!</p>

<p><em>Thank you, Fernie.</em></p>

<p>Oh, well, I think my work here is done. I'll tell people that the live album <strong>Brazil</strong> is really great, and that the new song 'The Longest Night' is very nifty, and much better than most of the songs here.</p>

<p><em>Thanks once again, Fernie. You did an excellent job.</em></p>

<p>I'll go home, now. I'm hungry! I also have some albums by Mr. Nettelbeck to review. See you later, Farmer Hay!</p>

<p>[credits roll up]</p>

<p>And look out for <strong>Fernie The Reviewer: The Album</strong> coming up this Winter!</p>

<p>Oh, and this reminds me of a joke I made up... Do you know what's Bob The Builder's favourite Cure song?</p>

<p>...?</p>
