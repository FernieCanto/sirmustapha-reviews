<p>New Wave. What the hell. There is no such genre as New Wave. Pretty much everything released by the late 70's could be named New Wave if it sounded convenient to the media and the record labels. Talking Heads is quite difficult to put into an specific genre. I guess they fall into Pop, but... <em>what</em> Pop? What do you call Pop with heavy emphasis in clashing rhythm guitars and unusual rhythms, vocal rants aplenty and... God knows what else. If someone comes up with a definition for Talking Heads' music, please let me know.</p>

<p>What matters is, these guys are great. Seriously. They brought into the spotlight an unusual kind of rock music, a kind of music that hadn't been explored very deeply before. These are a nice example of a band that made music the way <em>they</em> wanted to do, thus creating a couple of truly unique albums. There is a certain kind of <em>energy</em> that sparks from albums like <span class="album">More Songs About Buildings And Food</span> and <span class="album">Remain In Light</span> that no other band had managed to gather, and they manage to satisfy the two sides of my soul: the South American, son of Mother Africa, that likes to jerk his shoulders, tap his feet, swing his head and sing along to the music; and the European blooded pseudo-intellectual that likes to search for intelligence and meaning in music. Not that <em>all</em> of their music fits in the "dance" pattern, mind you: they only began sketching such brand of music in their second album, and its culmination would only come with their fourth release, <span class="album">Remain In Light</span>. Meanwhile, they still could come up with rather 'simple', but truly twisted and unpredictable pop music. Armed with rant-vocalist David Byrne, the counterpoint-guitarist Jerry Harrison, and the truly excellent rhythm combo of drummer Chris Franz and bassist Tina Weymouth - Tina particularly gets my thumbs up as a bassist.</p>

<p>For 3 years, the band had Brian Eno as their producer, and he really helped to shape the sound of the band, give it a rich texture and atmosphere, and ultimately bring it to its absolute full potential. Eno's collaboration with band might be one of the most successful collaborations I've ever witnessed, music-wise. The partnership ended when David felt Eno was putting the band in danger of breaking up, so he preferred to faithfully stick to his band rather than let his ego take over. And while David certainly was (and is) a heck of a genius by himself, he wouldn't be able to create the same kind of unique, twisted music without the band. So, thumbs up to our geeky friends. Talking Heads is easily one of my favourite bands coming from the USA - with only The Residents ahead of them, I think.</p>

<p>See here. Talking Heads were weird right from the beginning. They didn't bother with coming up with a flashy album cover, not even with an actual album title. I guess they spent that time writing the actual songs, and if that's the case, I think they've done it the right way. This album is great! You see, this may not be the same Talking Heads you used to hear in the radio all the time, with songs like 'Once In A Lifetime', 'Life During Wartime', 'Burning Down The Housetime' and 'And She Wastime'. This band here sounds like a simple bunch of people that came into a studio, played and recorded all the songs straight in one day, went home, and released the album the next day. Simple, direct, to-the-point and precise. Who needs anything more than that? This is <span class="album">Talking Heads: 77</span>.</p>

<p>And this is really one great album, if only because the songs are <em>so</em> different and unpredictable. They seem like they want to truly do their best of their instruments, and are unwilling to waste even a single second of the record. The songwriting is smart and entertaining, and that sounds enough for me. However, it <em>does</em> sound like the band was just "learning" at that time. Some places sound rather immature and na&iuml;ve, but that only adds to the fun of the recording! And  the "stripped down" nature of the sound only adds to this. You see, the music here sounds more or less like this: two guitars playing almost against each other, drums and bass, Byrne ranting all over, and sometimes an "extra", like a little piano, a little synth, or a little brass. That's all. No overdubs, no wild synth effects, no studio wizardry. Just an extremely tight performance of 11 wacked out, fascinating tunes.</p>

<p>Yes, there isn't one single song in here that I dislike. Even the most "average" ones have a couple of notable things about it, be it Byrne's wild vocal acrobacies, a creative guitar line, a memorable moment, or even a simple detail that jumps out at you with repeated listens. Sometimes, the very <em>meaning</em> of these songs make them outstanding - and I'm not talking strictly about lyrics, or the "intended" meaning. Very few of these songs have a strict meaning - they are <em>suggestive</em>, but they don't have strict meanings. Take 'Don't Worry About The Government', for example. The song is cutesy, bouncy and happy, and Byrne joyfully sings about living in a building. But, isn't there something <em>eerie</em> about the way the sings "I'm a lucky guy to live in my building" or "I'll put down what I'm doing, my friends are important", or even "my building has every convenience"? As if Byrne is immitating that kind of, erm, "brainwashed" happiness that's on the verge of falling apart? It's weird, I know, but it's the impression I get! Maybe Byrne didn't mean exactly that, but it's like I said: these songs are <em>suggestive</em>. You can come up with any meaning you want to come with for these songs, it is your imagination and not mine, after all. And yes, this song is one of my favourites in the album. The music delivers that "frightening happiness" very well.</p>

<p>Sometimes, these oddities aren't really eerie or disturbing, but they're simply downright <em>catchy</em>. The opener 'Uh Oh, Love Comes To Town' stuck to my mind the very first time around. That bassline, the gleeful vocals, the irresistible rhythm, the "OOOH OOOH OOOH OOOOOH OOOOOOH!!" finale... you know! Catchy! Very catchy! Other catchy oddities include 'New Feeling', that features some of the wildest Byrne rants in the record, and some of those strange chord changes that only Talking Heads could make so well. Then, there is 'Who Is It?', a ridiculous little wacked-out groove that doesn't go up to two minutes, irresistible in its dumbness. And there's 'Pulled Up', the song that features <em>the</em> wildest Byrne rants in the record. And there's the most famous song in the album, too - 'Psycho Killer', that really justifies its fame with a catchy bass line, a delightfully goofy performance and 'fa fa fa fa's aplenty.</p>

<p>But really, pretty much every song here is great, in some way. 'First Week / Last Week... Carefree' has a lovely Rhumba-like rhythm and a goofy sax line, 'Happy Day' is a truly lovely, odd ballad, and 'No Compassion' is the band's take on the "two songs in one" approach, and it works. Overall, if you really like the band's songwriting style, you need to get this one. These songs are seeds to many of the band's future glories. It is genuine Talking Heads, only lacking the truly refined Eno production and all. Draw whatever conclusions you want, but I still love this record.</p>

<p>Enter Brian Eno, and the band proceeds to record a groundbreaking, truly original album. Bastards, it's so easy for them. Er, *ahem*, anyway. Yes, this is one of those "genre defining" albums, whatever genre this is defining. Like I said before, I don't consider "New Wave" as a genre, as almost every band defined as "New Wave" is completely different from each other. But yes, this album was sure groundbreaking and original, even though I'm not able to enjoy it as much as its predecessor.</p>

<p>For starters, Eno came in and gave the band a sharp, tight sound, enhancing it in every possible way - and besides that, he provides some smart, subtle synth enhancements and instrument treatments. The two rhythm guitars are the true stars of the show here, though, and in almost every song, they provide the quirky, jerky, contradictory rhythm that's central to the album - and in the meantime, Chris and Tina provide a kickarse, funky rhythm section, and Byrne rants wildly. This album can be seen as the beginning of the "ranting David" era, where the doesn't exactly <em>sing</em>: he mutters, blabbers, yells and shrieks the lyrics instead of delivering an actual melody. The nature of this album led people to call it "paranoid", but I don't know exactly what it is supposed to be. It is never clear what exactly what Byrne is ranting about, but he <em>is</em> ranting, and the music around him is always quirky, jumpy and bouncy. Yeah, perhaps this is "paranoid", but only metaphorically "paranoid". I think.</p>

<p>The biggest positive point about this album is that it is very even, as in, <em>insistently</em> good. Even if the songs are much more similar to each other than they were on <span class="album">77</span>, there is always something to attract your attention. For example, 'With Our Love' has a truly shattering, sharp guitar work, 'Warning Sign' stars a cool treatment on the drums and a groovy bass line, 'The Girls Want To Be With The Girls' has a delightfully dorky organ popping in all the time, 'Artists Only' is even more dorky and nerdy Byrne vocal acrobatics ("I'm CLEANING, CLEANING again, I'm CLEANING, CLEANING my brain!!"), and 'I'm Not In Love' has a kool little guitar riff. The negative point is that, for some reason, I just fail to find that many <em>catchy</em> elements in the album. <span class="album">77</span> had all those infectiously catchy details that make the album truly enjoyable and fun. <span class="album">More Songs About Buildings And Food</span> may sound cool, professional and polished, but it's not not really... <em>fun</em>. These songs are just not very catchy. But that doesn't mean they're not good!</p>

<p>There are few "standouts" in the album, though some of the tunes do sound different from the rest. The opener 'Thank You For Sending Me An Angel' is a hilarious snippet of a march-like groove with Byrne going totally wild. The closer song, 'The Big Contry', is really a slow, lengthy song with some "laid-back" slidey guitar and Byrne reciting his impressive lyrics about not wanting to live in the rural zones of his big country. But I just don't like 'Take Me To The River' very much. I dunno, I guess I don't like that R&amp;B song style after all, and my problems are all against the song itself, not against the band's rendition. It's impressive how the band managed to put their own, unique identity into the song, but I just don't like it, really. It was included here due to influence of their record label, it seems, so the band's forgiven.</p>

<p>Among the other songs - the "meat" of the album - I think 'Found A Job' strikes me all the time. Tina plays a super-fun bass line while David goes talking about people "fighting over little things" and stuff. It's a really irresistible groove, with a fun instrumental coda. 'With Our Love' has its songwriting roots on 'New Feeling', and for me, that's a plus. 'Artists Only' is simply funny, and I love those pinging guitars, the organs and - like I mentioned before - David's vocal acrobatics. 'I'm Not In Love' is fairly catchy, actually, and has some more great instrumental work at the end. Only 'Stay Hungry' never truly caught me, but that's no mean feat. After all, the album brings up truly great ideas, and a unique, priceless sound. If it isn't "fun", well, that won't stop me from checking this out once in a while. It's still a worthwhile buy.</p>

<p>Yes, my Talking Heads experience began with <span class="album">Remain In Light</span>. But it was only thanks to <em>this</em> album that I was encouraged to go deeper into the band. Man, this is, like... <em>the</em> culmination of the Talking Headism... at least in the intellectual level. You know, as cool as <span class="album">More Songs About Buildings And Food</span> sounded, with the rich production and arrangements, it was just a slick, glossy sphere of coolness. It wasn't really catchy or exactly <em>memorable</em>, nor it seduced you or surround you in atmosphere... Well, this album does exactly that. At least, it did to <em>me</em>. This album, as soon as the first listen, struck me with all its power of seduction, and I was intrigued by it - something that I wasn't for either of the two previous Talking Heads releases. Their debut entertained me, and their second one pleased me very much. But this? This album is <em>addictive</em> as dang.</p>

<p>There might not be the same <em>quantity</em> of jerkiness, quirkiness and gloss as there was on <span class="album">More Songs About Buildings And Food</span>, but here, that jerkiness, quirkiness and gloss are used <em>cleverly</em>, and are interspersed with <em>other</em> cool qualities. This, of course, makes the album less monotonous. We get to see other sides of the Talking Heads music. With the help of Eno's producing skills, the music becomes atmospheric, deep, and - very importantly - <em>intriguing</em>. Unlike the previous albums, there is a sense of <em>meaning</em> in the album that makes me return very often to the album. And this sense of meaning and the atmospheric sound, combined with the excellent music, makes the album a complete package. Much more than <span class="album">Remain In Light</span>, I should say: while this is nowhere near the level of sonic perfection achieved in the 1980 masterpiece, this one is a much more satisfying listen. There is one place here, though, where the band really predicts the whole <span class="album">Remain In Light</span> sound: 'I Zimbra', a really brilliant track. For the first time, we witness the Talking Heads using busy, tribal rhythms with plenty of percussion effects, along with Dadaist lyrics provided by Hugo Ball poem, excited group chants, Tina making a bass groove with the least notes possible, and the fantastic rhythm guitar provided by David and Jerry, along with Eno's pal, Robert Fripp.</p>

<p>In other tracks, we get to see more of those untrivial, unpredictable chord changes. The songwriting here is a true improvement over <span class="album">More Songs About Buildings And Food</span>, and almost all songs here are truly, really <em>catchy</em>. They may be dark, and quite creepy at times, but these tunes pop up in my head all tie time. Each one is very different from the rest, which means that the album never gets boring. You know, what was the last time you heard a Talking Heads ballad, eh? You'll wanna check the gorgeous 'Heaven', that actually doesn't sound like paradise, but is still gorgeous nonetheless. In a less, um, "pleasant" tone, there is 'Mind', with a cool, weird "chuck-a-chuck-a-chuck-a-chuck-a" guitar riff, and David's disturbed moanings. And there's that whacked-out, "cosmic" atmosphere with Eno's synths and all. Very, very cool stuff.</p>

<p>As there was 'I Zimbra' predicting the tribal "World Music" sound, 'War During Lifetime' has an upbeat, funky, brass-laced dance rhythm with some of David's most hard-hitting, realistic lyrics in the record. Yeah, you can guess what it's all about. With titles like those, it's no big deal guessing what the lyrics talk about! Still, what is the <em>meaning</em> of David muttering "hold the paper up to the light! Some rays pass right through!", or rambling about a party in his mind ('Memories Can't Wait'), or talking about Heaven being a place where nothing happens, or going stark raving mad about animals, and concluding by saying that "air can hurt you too"? I don't know, but there <em>seems</em> to be something deep in that - musings of a troubled man about things around him, thinking that everything can harm him somehow - even air. I don't know, but it keeps me hooked. It's a cool album lyricswise, really, and I praise 'War During Lifetime' not only for the words, but also for that funky, catchy tune.</p>

<p>'Cities' is one of the album's most maddeningly addictive songs. David's rantings reach an absolute peak in here, and his performance is enough to make the whole song. Still, there's that electric piano by Eno, that keeps going "Pam, pa-bam. Pam, pa-bam." in the chorus, and more of that funky drumwork and rhythm guitar. 'Animals' is totally mad (well, at least the narrator of the song says he's mad), with guitars hammering out lines that don't really make sense - as if they ever needed to do so - and a hilarious finale. In a less crazy note, the short, catchy 'Paper' has the band at their most, um, "friendly", and the result is another great tune with more, great guitars.</p>

<p>One more song that's up there with my very favourites is the creepy, ominous 'Memories Can't Wait', with some of Eno's very best production jobs with the band. It is slow, dazed and disturbed, but oddly ends in a glorious climax... You know, this might be a quite darned great representation of one stuck in his own mind, as David seems to hint in the lyrics. On the flipside, 'Air' keeps the same "disturbed" climate, but with an even more abstract theme. The music <em>does</em> sound airy, but it's those "aaaaaair" chants that really do it to me. And this time, the ending sounds more on the disturbed side than in the glorious side. Finally, 'Drugs' ends the album making justice to its title. But this isn't the kind of "psychedelic" drugginess, nor the "scary" drugginess. David sounds just <em>weird</em> in here, and his performance is as goofy as on 'Psycho Killer', only more unfocused and augmented by sparse instrumentation that strikes at you are strategic points with blasts of noise and synth - not to mention the weird guitar "solo" at the end.</p>

<p>Many people describe the album as very "creepy", "scary", or whatever. But I'm not so sure as that. David sounds to me as <em>goofy</em> as he was ever been. Perhaps the album sounds "moody", but not really "creepy". At least, I'm not creeped-out by the album. What matters is that this album never loses my attention. Even the feeblest track, 'Electric Guitar' - a slow groove that does nothing in particular - only adds to the general atmosphere. To me, this is the best Talking Heads there can be, and I don't think nothing can change that. This album satisfies me in a way no other album by these guys can do.</p>

<p>This is the album that everyone in the world hails as the best Talking Heads album ever. Well, of course, this might be the most accomplished Talking Heads album ever. For one, the music reaches an absolute zenith here. It's like band and producer spent months in making the album sound as <em>full</em>, complete, perfect and striking as possible. It's like they took every little aspect of the album, analysed it, and set it to the absolute maximum. Nothing compares to the music in this album, really. As polished as <span class="album">More Songs About Buildings And Food</span> was, and as atmospheric as <span class="album">Fear Of Music</span> was, this is the album that completely reveals the full, true glory of the "Talking Heads sound". And that's pretty much a fact. Liking the record or not, you gotta admit that this was <em>the</em> peak of the mountain for the band as musicians, with Brian Eno firmly in control of production duties.</p>

<p>Well, actually, I'd dare say that Brian Eno is firmly in control of several other things than production duties. He shares songwriting credits with the rest of the band for all compositions, and, with a closer look, it becomes painfully obvious how similar this album is to other Eno-related albums in terms of structures. See? The first half of the album is dedicated to the faster, bouncier and more energetic songs, and the second half completely "mellows out". And this is the same structure Eno used for his own <span class="album">Before And After Science</span>, and David Bowie's <span class="album">Low</span> and <span class="album">Heroes</span> (those two are even more drastically "divided"), and that is definitely no coincidence. And don't forget that, just before this album, Eno and Byrne had released <span class="album">My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts</span>, that, in the words of Eno, is "a laboratory for the Talking Heads album". It was obvious that this album is son of Eno and Byrne (in a purely metaphorical sense - <em>please</em>, take these silly ideas out of your dirty mind!), and it was mostly because of that that David decided to drop Eno.</p>

<p>But anyway, this album. Yes, it's the total culmination of the Talking Heads sound. Problem is, <span class="album">Fear Of Music</span> had a great sound <em>and more</em>. It had a sense of meaning, an atmosphere. It had lots of things behind that sound. <span class="album">Remain In Light</span> is, mostly, sound and sound <em>only</em>. David, at most part, rants and rants, but he rants about <em>something</em>... and it doesn't quite <em>mean</em> anything. 'Once In A Lifetime' is the exception, and a heck of an exception. David's lyrics are hard-hitting in this one, but then, it sounds even more abstract than anything on <span class="album">Fear Of Music</span>. In the other songs, it almost sounds like David simply put together strings of disjointed statements that don't fit together - like in 'Born Under Punches'. Most impressive, though, is that David <em>forces</em> these statements to fit together, and the result is quite amusing. But still, I fail to grab an overall <em>essence</em> like I did on <span class="album">Fear Of Music</span>. Pardon me, I think that was actually the <em>point</em>: be damned if the album doesn't have meaning or "essence". The band was trying to make a <em>statement</em> with this album, and in <em>that</em>, they were successful. They certainly were.</p>

<p>I won't fool you, and I'll say right away that the first half of the album easily outshines the second. Notice that it's almost the opposite of <span class="album">Before And After Science</span>: fans tend to rave about the B side of Eno's masterpiece. But here, the consensus seems to point that side A is the best. And how couldn't it be? You know, the band sure is good when they are "mellow", but this isn't what makes them <em>special</em>. The "mellow" spots in <span class="album">Fear Of Music</span> were much better because they were atmospheric and whacked-out. These four songs aren't (though I should add that an LP I've found at a second-hand store places 'Once In A Lifetime' in side B, <em>not</em> side A! For Chrissake, where's the <em>symmetry</em>?), but I still think they're great. 'Houses In Motion' has David simply moaning over a groovy background, and the backing vocals chanting something catchy in the chorus (I can clearly hear Eno's vocals in there. Mommy, that ugly bald man is scaring me). I also like that solo by a God-knows-what instrument. 'Seen And Not Seen' is better, with a truly gorgeous, dreamy background - <em>great</em> Eno work - and 'Listening Wind' slows the trip down even more, with a slow, spooky and whispery atmosphere to this slightly reggaeish groove. Finally, 'The Overload' makes justice to its title, ending the album in a sombre, sluggish 6-minute drone. But it's good, though, and is quite the opposite of the hopeful, optimistic ending to <span class="album">Before And After Science</span>...</p>

<p>And yeah, that's it. Now, the first half... Well, here lies the gold. Really. From the very first song, the band goes straight into 2nd gear with the bumpy, bouncy, jagged rhythm of 'Born Under Punches', my favourite in the album. David supplies some of his nuttiest vocal pyrotechnics <em>ever</em>, while the whole band goes on making those wacky lines that bounce into each other, going "click-a-click-a, doo-doo-doo-doo, ping-ping-ping, click-a-click-a, boo-doo-boo-doo, beep-beep etc." The rhythm completely <em>makes</em> the song, and as a bonus, you have an infectious "and the heat goes on! and the heat goes on!" chant in the end, and a completely mad synth-like guitar solo - at least, I <em>hear</em> it is Adrian Belew on guitar, making all those noises, but listening to it, I almost refuse to believe. Is that <em>really</em> Adrian Belew? If he is, he should be upgraded to the status of Guitar God immediately.</p>

<p>'Crosseyed And Painless' engages the 4rd gear and speeds through that weird, dissonant guitar line that simply doesn't go away. Great rhythm, great vocal lines, great guitar work, and you know the rest. Plus, it is based <em>entirely</em> in one chord <em>only</em>. Weird, eh? If you're not blown away by now, 'The Great Curve' <em>will</em> blow you away. It engages the 6th gear and speeds up <em>like mad</em>, once again through one chord only. But who cares about the number of chords? If the insanely fast groove doesn't start making your blood boil, go out, have sex, and learn what life is all about - i.e., <span class="album">Dark Side Of The Moon</span>. But anyway, as soon as that symphony of voices blast through your speakers, you'll understand why this album is the musical zenith of the Talking Heads. Adrian Belew plays <em>the</em> guitar solo, and the band chants "WORLD OF LIIIIIGHT, SHE'S GONNA OPEN OUR E-E-EYES UP!" as if they're praising the goddess of Music - Lisa Simpson - or something. It's ultimate coolness. And, of course, who can forget 'Once In A Lifetime'? For the first time, the band makes a song that's fairly <em>friendly</em> for the public - no Psycho Killers quest-ce-que c'est, no life during wartime or anything weird. This one is a heck of a catchy, beautiful and intriguing tune. Those shining synths, the two note bass line, the catchy vocals in the chorus - it ain't exactly what makes the Talking Heads <em>unique</em>, but it works amazingly well. Certainly nobody other than Talking Heads could write something as strange and catchy as this.</p>

<p>But whatever praise I can give to this album, <span class="album">Fear Of Music</span> will always sound better to my ears. I don't think it's yet another case of "personal taste", though - that album is <em>really</em> special to me, "special" in a way <span class="album">Remain In Light</span> can never be. But, if it works as a "consolation", one thing that I can't accuse this album of is being <em>uncatchy</em>. Practically all of these songs are catchy and addictive in some way. It might not be my favourite Talking Heads album ever, but if this album isn't great, I don't know what is.</p>

<p>The band needed a three year break to go their own ways, do their own stuff, so that they could come back together and make another album. Brian Eno was away already, probably teaming up with Daniel Lanois and Harold Budd and about to become producer for U2. Without him in sight, the band made clear that they didn't want to keep going in the <span class="album">Remain In Light</span> way because... well, from there, there was nowhere to go. They felt that <span class="album">Remain In Light</span> was their peak as musicians, and they just didn't want to try the formula again. Instead, they wanted to have fun. The result was <span class="album">Speaking In Tongues</span>.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, you'll realise this is a stepback - but a <em>counscious</em> stepback, of course. Gone is the impeccable production work, gone is the fantastic guitar and synth work, gone are the multi-multi-layered instruments and voices, gone is the effort to make each song as perfect as possible. These songs are mostly dance ditties written to be accessible, catchy and fun. Of course, rabid fans might have thought it was sacrilege for the Heads to ignore what was best about them. But what's impressive is that, even doing only half of what they were capable of, they managed to pull out something great. This might not be comparable to <span class="album">Fear Of Music</span> or <span class="album">Remain In Light</span>, but it's still a great album to listen to. These dance ditties <em>are</em> accessible, catchy and fun, and for an album of dance ditties, this is alright to me. The songs are pretty simple - twitchy guitars, well-placed synth "embellishments", David Byrne vocal pyrotechnics and catchy - <em>really</em> catchy - lines are the main formula here.</p>

<p>Not that this album is <em>all</em> dance ditties, mind you. 'Slippery People' and 'I Get Wild - Wild Gravity' are two "mellow" songs, and they're good. The former has a great bass line, a clever call-and-response chorus and lots of neat things, and the latter is darker and more mysterious, with a catchy chorus and reggaeish sounds. And there is, of course, 'This Must Be The Place'. It's a very, very beautiful song, and it's somewhat interesting to see the band making a "very beautiful song" that's not beautiful in some weird way. That cute, pinging guitar line, the synth lines, the vocal melodies... yes, very naïve, indeed, and very captivating.</p>

<p>'Swamp' is the band's absolutely ridiculous attempt at Blues... and while it's obviously comical, I can't enjoy it very much, really. I don't like this brand of stupid Blues, no matter how intentionally stupid it is. I just don't like it, even though David's singing in the chorus is totally funny. And... that's that. The rest is major dance action, dude, and <em>great</em> dance action. I'm not a great fan of "dance" albums, but this one does keep me happy. It displays the typical intelligence of David Byrne with strange, ambivalent lyrics and performances that just defy the norms. All your base are belong to us. It's like the band is really making it <em>clear</em> that they're different from the rest. And I like that! Even being so difference, the band managed to make a hit with 'Burning Down The House' - and how can you resist those band choruses going "BURNING DOWN THE HOUSE!" like that? Just simply irresistible. 'Girlfriend Is Better' is better, indeed, at least to me. I like that rhythm, the catchy vocal lines, and the singing in the chorus. 'Making Flippy Floppy' is pretty weird, too: faster, bouncier, and it has the vocals alternating with cool effects in the chorus. Cool bass line, too. In side B, we have stranger, more "discoish" stuff with 'Moon Rocks'. You know, not many people like the song, but I just can't resist its obviousness. 'Pull Up The Roots' reaches a quite weird place, with a synth bass that reminds me of Queen's <span class="album">Hot Space</span>... Not that this is either good or bad. The song's cool, and that's that.</p>

<p>Cool album, I says. Of course, I made sure to snatch the album with the long, unedited songs. The LP reduces a lot the songs in side A - 'Slippery People' loses one minute and a half of its duration! Yup, so there. I will not mourn the loss of Eno because I kinda agree with David when he fired the man. It was better this way than if the band tried to follow the formula and end with something weaker. Some things just don't deserve to be done again.</p>

<p>Apparently the band liked being famous, so they ABSOLUTELY SOLD-OUT WITH THIS ALBUM... Okay, that's me overreacting. The fact is, Talking Heads decided to release an all Pop album to get on with the popularity surge they got with 'Burning Down The House', and all. It seems they succeeded. And how couldn't they? This album SCREAMS "I am catchy!" at the listeners, and we know things like that make success, want it or not.</p>

<p>I want you to understand that I have nothing against Pop music when it's done competently. I'm not those guys who think Pop is for simpletons, and only enjoys the weird and the artistic. I'm also not offended by this "sell-out" topic. It's okay for Talking Heads to go pop, since they had done their best on <span class="album">Fear Of Music</span> and <span class="album">Remain In Light</span>, anyway. They can have fun, and who am I to stop it? Thing is, I don't like this album, really. It's just that this album is <em>WAY</em> too glossy, shiny, happy sugary poppy to my tastes. It seems like the band didn't know SHIT about making Pop music, and so they decided to take the ABSOLUTELY SAFEST path to making Pop music, even if that meant that the songs didn't display an ounce of true originality. I know I'm being dire, but that's how I feel. As a result, this album IS poppy and catchy, but it is poppy and catchy in the way I most hate: it is innoffensive. And for a band like Talking Heads, whose main goal was to twist your mind, being innoffensive is a bit... alarming.</p>

<p>I mean, since the very first song, 'And She Was', you'll know that. This song is SO INNOFFENSIVE that it's absolutely sickening, and I just can't enjoy this kind of Pop music. It is too <em>obviously</em> written to be a hit, and they didn't even care to put something... <em>different</em>, to make it truly memorable. Ok, so David Byrne does write his strange, unclear and ambivalent lyrics to try to give the Talking Heads flavour to the music, but in a pop album like this, why should I give a shit to the lyrics? Ok, so there's one spot where the lyrics win me over, and it is 'Give Me Back My Name', with that talk about names and words and all. And the music is quite cool, too, so I like it a lot. Isn't the song title rather intriguing, too? "Give me back my name?" No, they aren't! They were dedicated to <em>me</em> when that cartoon character, Fernando Toro, stole my name. That son of a bull. Curse you, Ferny. I hate you for loving you so much... Damn, I should trademark that line before Robert Smith steals it for his next angsty song!</p>

<p>(and watch out for the newest David Byrne album coming soon, with the mega hits 'Give Me Back My Line' and 'Give Me Back My Godawful Joke')</p>

<p>The next two songs are actually goodies, too. 'Creatures Of Love' is a fucking Bluegrass ballad, and I must be sincere and say I <em>hate</em> Bluegrass. This is the place where I truly uncover all my South Americanism and say I <em>hate</em> North American Country music. Really. And 'Creatures Of Love' is <em>totally</em> a Country ballad, and I must say, a totally PREDICTABLE Country ballad. When that chorus came in, I could predict every single note Byrne sang, down to the "creatures of <em>lo-o-o-ove</em>" flourish, and I hate that. But there's something truly cute and pretty about that song that I can't ignore and/or resist, so there - even if those "poetic" lyrics about sperm are kinda stupid. "I've seen sex and I think it's alright". Well, I have <em>seen</em> sex, too, and I wanted to turn off the TV and put on <span class="album">Fear Of Music</span> in my turntable and forget that David Byrne wrote those words. Sorry. 'The Lady Don't Mind' is - gasp - an <em>unpredictable</em> song in here, really. It's good! It's quite <em>genuinely</em> catchy, and this one deserves far more merit than the hit 'And She Was'.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, here's where the goodies stop and the clich&eacute;s come in. I mean, the chorus of 'Perfect World' is an obvious clich&eacute;, and I can't tolerate that. That "beautiful" modulation, the melody, all of it. I don't like this. Is it catchy? Maybe. There are a million other songs relying on the same clich&eacute;, so I think it might work. No, don't like the song - even with that fun, little bass line - and it might be my least favourite Talking Heads song up to this point. It's a shame to see David so... restrained by these melodies, and his "woo hoos" and "hey hey heys" are so dorkily out-of-place and inadequate that they almost work.</p>

<p>'Stay Up Late' begins the side B, and things don't get much better. Heck, this one isn't even catchy. I always forgot how it went. Ok, so now I remember, but I have a good musical memory. 'Walk It Down' isn't one ounce better. This one has an even dumber chorus. "Walk it down! Talk it down! Wo-o-oah" Eeek, that "wo-o-oah" makes my brain itch. Plus, it's the only potential hook in the song, and it's not a good one. 'Television Man' gets things a little better, with much less clich&eacute;d chord progression and melody, and a funny "na na na na naa naa!" call-and-response part, followed by frenzied percussion. Cool, I guess.</p>

<p>And it ends with 'Road To Nowhere'. When it began with that Gospel choir (another thing I hate about the North American culture - Gospel choirs. Geez, guys, couldn't you be a little less obvious about your nationality, like The Residents?), I immediately thought I was about to receive the ultimate torture... but I wasn't! The song has an unbeatable hook and a fun marching rhythm. It's good, but what happens at the very end? It sounds like the guys forgot how the harmony went, and totally screw up the line. Eek. Oh, well, there it is. To give the album a bit of its merit, I should say this is great for the fans of David Byrne's singing voice, because here's the place where he reveals himself as the truly talented singer that he is. Also, Tina Weymouth reveals herself as one of the most annoying backing vocals - she sounds like my younger sister singing along to the radio - but that's okay. Anyway, I voiced all my bitter complaints. Don't you think it's a bad album, though... but the way it turned out, I wish it <em>were</em> bad, so it would be a bit more distinctive. I don't think I'll listen to this album again, really: next time I want to hear generic pop, I'll probably put on <span class="album">Heaven's Open</span> instead of this. At least that one has Mike Oldfield singing <em>serious</em> lead vocals for the first time in his carreer, and has many more original twists than this one has. Plus, it has 'Music For The Balcony', but that's for another story. As it is, <span class="album">Little Creatures</span> is condemned to fall in the dreaded 7 grade: it's good, people like it, but I just don't have any feelings for it. What can be worse than that?</p>

<p>I'm probably alone in this one, but I like this album <em>much more</em> than I do <span class="album">Little Creatures</span> - but that's ok, because I'm used to being alone. I know, I'm only rating this album half a point above <span class="album">Little Creatures</span>, but you oughta understand that, while <span class="album">Little Creatures</span> gets a 7 and stands in the "Quite good" territory, I <em>don't like</em> that album. Really. The more I think about that album, the more irritated I get. This one, however, gets a 7.5 and I do like it, and I enjoy it. This might sound like a travesty to many people, since this is probably the most hated Talking Heads album of all time, but it's true. I'm able to enjoy this album while I almost don't enjoy <span class="album">Little Creatures</span> <em>at all</em>.</p>

<p>These nine songs were featured in a movie directed by David Byrne (titled, unsurprisingly, <em>True Stories</em>), but this album isn't a "soundtrack". What happens is that the band merely plays the movie songs, so this is, in all aspects, a genuine Talking Heads <em>album</em>. Now, I don't know <em>exactly</em> what people have against this album. The genre here is mainly "pop", the same kind of silly pop presented on <span class="album">Little Creatures</span>, but less serious and more cheesy. Now, what <em>exactly</em> is the accusation? Is it that the songs are too cheesy? Too simple? Too banal? I can't tell, but... well, heck, some of these songs are really good. My main complaint against the album is that two of the worst Talking Heads songs ever are placed back-to-back on side A. I'm talking about 'Puzzlin' Evidence' and 'Hey Now', if you didn't notice. The former sounds like... you know, it sounds like an intro tune to a kids cartoon show. It's fast, boppy, organ-dominated and silly. But it goes on and on and on for five months, and there is that awful Gospel choir that chants the title of the song every 2 seconds. It's just too stupid and pointless to me. And then, 'Hey Now' is even worse. It sounds like a song for a Disney cartoon... and heck, I <em>hate</em> songs off Disney cartoons. This one is a <em>really</em> silly, Caribbean-like tune, and damn, but I <em>can</em> visualise Timon, Pumbaa, Simba and all the creatures of the forest coming together to sing "Hey, now! Hey, now! Hey, now, now! Hey, now! Hey, now! Hey, now, now!" and, trust me, that's an <em>awful</em> mental image. It might work in Byrne's movie, but in this album, it doesn't sound like the kind of "silly fun" that I can have without problems. It sounds like "Hey, you! Sitting in that chair! I demand you to wave your hands in the air and sing to this chorus that goes 'Hey, now! Hey, now! Hey, now, now! Hey, now! Hey, now! Hey, now, now!' for an eternity." And really, that isn't my cup of tea. I can't understand why it seems to go on for so long. Sorry, but I know a much better song called 'Hey Now', and it's performed by a band called Oasis.</p>

<p>But that's it, really. All other songs are kinda ok. 'Papa Legba' is a really slow song with all those percussion sounds and "World Beat" thang that probably mocks the stuff from side B of <span class="album">Remain In Light</span>, but it doesn't offend me. It's not bad, really. And the opener, 'Love For Sale', is the most demented kind of demented rock 'n' roll you can find - it goes with a stupid, demented riff for a bar, and only the drums remain in the next bar. You know that picture, dontcha? Still, I like that song, it's fun. But from all these other tunes in side B, they're definitely a stretch of solid, wacky-sounding pop tunes. 'Wild, Wild Life' is a bit similar to 'Love For Sale', but it ditches the demented riff and inserts some <em>really</em> catchy hooks. Hey, <em>this</em> is a great, silly pop tune! And, dang it, but I really love 'Radio Head' and 'People Like Us'. They're both cute, catchy, and fun to sing along to. I don't know why I should hold any hatred against them. I don't care if this is the same band that wrote <span class="album">Fear Of Music</span> seven years ago! These songs are a-ok! Plus, do you realise that the former is called "Radio Head"?</p>

<p>There are ballads here, too. 'Dream Operator' is a little 3/4 ballad, and a really pretty one. 'City Of Dreams' isn't as good, because it's just way too... uh, I don't know. Maybe too "self-awarely beautiful" in all its grandeur. I actually prefer 'Road To Nowhere' as a grandiose album closer... Ok, there, I said a word of praise in favour of <span class="album">Little Creatures</span> over this one, but really... next time I want to hear a "minor" Talking Heads album, I'll take this over <span class="album">Little Creatures</span> <em>any time</em>. Of course, don't think the album is <em>great</em>, really. It doesn't hold a candle to <span class="album">More Songs About Buildings And Food</span>, for example, and those two damn songs in side A force me to grade it lower than 8. But other than that, I like this album.</p>

<p>*shudder* Sure David Byrne could come up with some annoying album titles. I mean, it's not like I'm ashamed of the word "Naked", but it can rub me in the wrong way when I'm not in a good mood - especially when one of the songs is titled "Mommy Daddy You And I". You know? Maybe you don't know what I'm talking about precisely, but this week, I was just struck with a series of bad memories from when I was, I think, 16... Ok, I'll just come and out say it; they were porn pics of The Simpsons. Yeah, yeah, I can hear the audience groaning already. But it does annoy me a lot. I mean, there are some of those 'pics' that are obviously humourous, and I recall - one or two years ago, when I was in the computer lab of the Technical School, I saw a student checking her e-mail box a few computers ahead of me, and she was looking at those pictures sent to her by a friend, I suppose. And she was giggling, of course, because crude pics of The Simpsons having sex is funny. Ok, I kinda can forgive that thought, because they are just cartoons, blah blah blah. But what I <em>really</em> can't forgive are the other kind of pics: the smooth, professional ones depicting, for example, Lisa and Bart fucking each other, and <em>enjoying</em> it. I get <em>really</em> disturbed at the sight of Lisa contorting her face in incestuous lust. Do people get horny with that? There are just so many things wrong with that - underage sex, incest, you name it. But what really punches me in the chin is that, you know, I'm a <em>huge</em> fan of Lisa, and I feel hurt with that. Those pics are so damn <em>realistic</em>, and they are made with truly erotic intent. Damn! What's up with that, seriously? Lisa, the girl who always pops up in my mind when I'm feeling melancholic, and when I'm feeling happy, enjoys wonderful sex with Bart. I can almost hear her moaning. That's not funny.</p>

<p>And, of course, we can't forget the doomed souls that invade the Simpsons newsgroups asking for Simpsons porn. It's a clich&eacute;, already. And what's worse, 80% of the time, they're asking for <em>Lisa Simpson porn</em>. Go and search it for youself, if you dare. Lisa porn is littering the Web. I feel particularly hurt with that. It really depresses me. No, I won't put links to such sites, really. If you want it, go and search a few samples for yourself, and show the world what a demented sicko you are. Either that, or you just don't believe what I'm saying, and want to see it for yourself. In that case, well, you better come back to this page and admit that I'm right. It isn't about the paedophilia or incest. Those people are torturing the last remains of true innocence left inside of me. What should I do? Ignore it? Forget it exists? Well, I, frankly, prefer to vent all these feelings in my own website, in my own Talking Heads review. Look at that. Two paragraphs already. By this point, you should have a good insight on what Talking Heads' last album, <span class="album">Naked</span>, is. Damn me and my Lisa Simpson fanatism. No, damn the Lisa porn. Yes.</p>

<p>Essentially, this album is the last one that the band did, and in here, David Byrne wanted to ditch the pop and do the kind of serious music the band did before <span class="album">Little Creatures</span>. And did he succeed? Well, I think so. The album's pretty damn serious, in its own, Byrnesque way. But you should be aware that you shouldn't be expecting another <span class="album">More Songs About Buildings And Food</span> or another <span class="album">Remain In Light</span> here. Remember all those numerous production tricks and simple, but masterful musicianship? Well, forget it. These compositions and arrangements aren't really complex, anymore. On most of these tracks, David gives emphasis to the Latin American rhythms instead. And they're <em>real</em> Latin American rhythms, with brasses, percussions and all. David rants like mad on top of them, but what's important is that they are not trying to blow you away with refined sonic textures anymore.</p>

<p>And what do I think about it? Well, I won't fool you. I love this record. This is <em>not</em> the same Talking Heads of yore, in essence. This is a different band. You'll just have to dig the rhythms, the flashes of melody and David's ability to capture your mind and don't let go. I guess I'm in advantage, because I <em>am</em> Latin American, and damn me if I don't just <em>love</em> these rhythms. 'Blind' opens the record rocking and shaking more than anything on <span class="album">Speaking In Tongues</span>; 'Mr. Jones' is a hot, steamy Mambo; '(Nothing But) Flowers' is pure, unadultered Lambada... and there are the songs which don't carry those Latin rhythms so clearly, but they're all cool. The music here isn't as <em>mindblowing</em> as it once used to be, but damn it, these songs are catchy and great! Almost everything here is much catchier than anything on <span class="album">Little Creatures</span>, because Byrne is trying to do <em>his</em> this again, not just run into the arms of clich&eacute;d pop songwriting. As a result, we have gems like '(Nothing But) Flowers', for example. The lyrics are great. I love it when David simply write the exact opposite of what people expect. The narrator of the song appears in an utopic "Green" world, and misses the city and all its conveniences. "We used to microwave, now we just eat nuts and berries!" Man, tell me you expected that.</p>

<p>The album begins on a high note, actually. The first time I heard the opening track, I couldn't help wondering "GOD, what happened to David's voice? He seems to have smoked an entire cigarrete factory and aged 30 years after <span class="album">True Stories</span>", but later on, I realised that was just another of David's vocal tricks. Stupid me. Yeah, the song rocks. 'Mr. Jones' keeps up the goodiness, too. I just can't help loving the way the band plays this music, and makes it sound so <em>genuine</em>. This isn't a half-arsed immitation of Latin music. This <em>is</em> Latin music. Kudos to them for that. 'Totally Nude' (there comes the Lisa porn imagery again - stay good, Fernie, stay good!) is like a Caribbean ballad with slidey guitars and all, and it's pretty cute. Very nice. And 'Ruby Dear'? Man, those percussions are cool, and David slips throught he vocal melody with ease.</p>

<p>The album tones down with 'The Democratic Circus', with all its mystery and subtle (and not-so-subtle) darkness. And it rules. Really. The vocal melody is great, and the band is able to completely twist the atmosphere with a simple wave of their hand, finishing the song in a really dark tone. I will admit that 'The Facts Of Life' plods and plods for way too long, and ends up sounding way too monotonous and dull towards the end. Yes, I'll admit that the tracks up until track 10, from here, sound rather dull. But not <em>too much</em> of a big deal, because 'Mommy Daddy You And I' is cool. I like those lyrics, again, of a family of immigrants in America, or something similar. 'Big Daddy' and 'Bill' stretch it a bit too much, even though I still enjoy them quite a bit. Yeah, it sounds like the band ran out of steam towards the end. I admit that, and maybe I should even complain about that. But it seems people complain that the whole album is boring and mediocre. Or they just don't enjoy this kind of music. Maybe I <em>shouldn't</em> enjoy this album so much, but sorry... I do. Plus, there's 'Cool Water', a really, really cool, dark closer. It's not exaggeratedly ominous, and works better than, say, 'The Overload'. That was a miserable comparison... What I mean is just that this song rules, and really triggers my nerves in a way no other Talking Heads song can do. Really!</p>

<p>There is nothing I can do. This album grew on me, and suddenly I realised that this album isn't any bad as some people say. Of course, you might dislike it, but that's your problem. But if you give it a chance, I think you can like it, too. I love it, and I'm not afraid of giving it a particularly high grade.</p>

<p>And I swear this is the last time I talk about Lisa porn in this site.</p>

<p>This is the second LP David Byrne released under his name. Talking Heads was already broken up by this point, and Mr. Frontman was free to fulfill all his solo carreer fantasies. So, this is the next step after <span class="album">Naked</span>: When the last Talking Heads album combined North American songwriting with African and Latin music and instruments, this album goes deep into the Latin American culture and brings out the <em>roots</em> music from the land. This album isn't David Byrne experimenting with the regional music. This album <em>is</em> the regional music: most people playing here are Latin American, some of them share songwriting credits with David in some tracks, there are lyrics in Spanish and Portuguese dialoguing with David's trademark rants, and the rhythms and melodies are pretty much genuine. The most sceptical ones could say that this is only a field experiment, with David <em>studying</em> the local music instead of performing it, and the most cynical ones could even say David <em>pretends</em> to perform it, sticking in the names of the rhythms after the track titles in the sleeve and titling the album "<span class="album">Rei Momo</span>" after a famous folkloric Brazilian personage, thinking it would be enough.</p>

<p>But of course that's not enough. And, no matter how sceptical and cynical I could pretend to be, there's no way I could say those things about the album. If David was really just making "field experiment" with these songs, how come they are so <em>good</em>? It sounds pretty clear to me that David put true effort and energy into the work, and that he cared for it. Possibly he <em>was</em> trying to "study" the music by getting seriously into it, but he was really interested in the culture of the place, not just acting as a poseur. Nah, if he was a poseur, he would have made the project <em>far</em> more grandiose than it turned out to be. And anyway, like I said, these songs are good. <em>Great</em>, in fact. The melodies are rich and warm, the lyrics truly make justice to Byrne's legacy, they are thought-provoking and, overall, fun to listen to. I think you'll just give the record some time, if you really don't feel comfortable with all these Latin rhythms. Even <em>I</em> felt a little bit estranged the first times around, but with just a few listens, I truly realised what was going on, and the songs became filled with hot energy and spark. With songs as fun as these, you have more than enough material to tap your feet and yank your shoulders to, aside from enjoying the vocal melodies and all the nifty work by the backing musicians.</p>

<p>Like I said, each track is indicated with the "genre" of music it follows. And while you may be familiar with words like "Merengue", "Samba" and "Salsa / Reggae", you might frown at strange names like "Or&iuml;sa", "Charanga" and "Mapey&eacute;". But that's the least important thing. Overall, each track is pretty much unique. And maybe it's national bias, but the two samba tracks here - 'Don't Want To Be Part Of Your World' and 'Office Cowboy' - are my favourite songs. And even if both <em>are</em> samba, they're still different from each other: the former is a slower, more "rootsy" samba, with a full-blown brass section arrangement and a cuica solo. The song itself is brilliant: the "floating" melody of the verses is countered with the sudden, bright hook of the chorus. The vocals are brilliant to follow, with David truly getting into the "Don't want, don't want, don't want to be part of your world" frenzy, aided by the awesome brass arrangements. 'Office Cowboy', on the other hand, follows the fast, danceable samba of the Carnival as most tourists know it, and the vocal melodies are as great as they could be. David shares the vocal duties with Herbert Vianna, a guy who I'm very fond of, who was, and still is, the frontman of a Brazilian band.</p>

<p>But the non-samba ones are just as worthwhile and good. My favourite among these is 'Carnival Eyes,' that has nothing to do with Brazilian samba really, in spite of its title. But the melody is wonderful. The album actually begins on a rather slow pace, with 'Independence Day'. And while the "energy" level may seem low in the track, it's merely because of the style of playing. It's more laid back, and David goes as far as to bring a fiddle solo, to give a Country taste to the tune. At first, it may seem like the rest of the album is going to bring dirty tricks like those, but that's not true. In many tracks, he's aided by backing vocalists who are very characteristic of Central American music. And they show up on the second track already, 'Make Believe Mambo', that truly sounds like mambo, though it's listed as an "Or&iuml;sa". Don't ask me about the difference between the two terms, but you'll recognise the rhythm if you listen to it. Again, great melody, and the lyrics are very Byrnian. Dig the part with the choir going "In my mundo, todo mundo" with David.</p>

<p>Talk about Byrnian lyrics: on a purely lyrical level, 'The Dream Police', with little or no tinkering, could easily fit on one of Talking Heads' classic albums. But here, it's backed by a Cha Cha Cha, which gives it a blissfully sarcastic tone. But the thematics are more abstract and vague - don't want to make social critics and protests in such a fun record, eh? So, you get 'The Call Of The Wild', a poem of true beauty - backed by wonderful music, of course. It's one of the most beautiful tracks, here. 'The Rose Tattoo' has a rhythm reminiscent of 'Mr Jones', from <span class="album">Naked</span>, and Mexican-sounding backing vocalists. 'Lie To Me' is another goodie, using the same Merengue rhythm of 'The Call Of The Wild' for a more fun purpose. Maybe my least favourite here is 'Loco De Amor', but I'm not sure at all why it should be. It's listed as "Salsa / Reggae", but I doubt you'll hear Reggae in it. It's good, too, but a tad more repetitive. But then, you get 'Marching Through The Wilderness', a more laidback tune with a supernifty strings riff, and more of those tasteful melodies.</p>

<p>Overall, it may take a few listens for you to realise it, but these songs are so well written, they truly blow away any feeling that they are just gimmicks. And the performances <em>are</em> energetic, once you understand them. And the project turned out to be a stunning success, in the end. Few artists can penetrate different cultures and churn out works of pure beauty like these. Can <em>you</em> do it? It's not as easy as it seems. You have all sorts of examples of bands trying to do "Eastern" tinged songs, or draw Chinese influences, or whatever kind of influence you may think of. The Cure is there for that. But is it really such a trivial matter to listen to the actual music from the place, <em>care</em> for it, and not just take it for yourself, but try and <em>contribute</em> something to the scene? Honestly, it's a shame that this record is so obscure around here. But I guess people just don't recognise the name "David Byrne", after all. But I can see 'Office Cowboy' being played often on our radios, and what worse, <em>beating</em> many actual Brazilian songs. And the effect would be even better if it was credited as "David Byrne &amp; Herbert Vianna". For your information, Herbert Vianna <em>is</em> extremely famous around here. He even almost died a few years ago.</p>

<div class="comments">
<p>I don't see a review on your site of some other David Byrne solo records; I haven't heard "<span class="album">Uh Oh</span>" but I have "<span class="album">Look Into The Eyeball</span>" which I consider better than "<span class="album">Grown Backwards</span>". I would give "<span class="album">Look</span>" a 9.5 and "<span class="album">Grown</span>" 8.5 or 9, though I admit it is truly fresh and different.</p>

<p>I think "<span class="album">Rei Momo</span>" is his post-Heads 10.</p>

<p>I didn't listen to <span class="album">Rei Momo</span> until a few years after it was released, but fell in love with it when I did. What you say is true: he could never have made this masterpiece if he did not truly care. On at least one drive to and from North Carolina where I was born (I live in Massachusetts 900 mi./1400 km. away) I listened to a tape of <span class="album">Rei Momo</span> over and over, because it is so rich, it can be heard many times before you hear everyting. In between I listened to the Os Mutantes collection which David Byrne released on his Luaka Bop label.</p>

<p>When <span class="album">Eyeball</span> was released, my stepson dragged me off to Providence to see David Byrne at Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel, a venue which holds only about 2000 people I would say, so we could get close. Providence, about a 45 minute drive from here, is where he went to art school and met some of the band (they went to New York from there) so it was once his stomping ground. He played a short set (an hour or so) and got done about midnight. Some might be disappointed by this short show, but it was good, we were close to the stage, and then we went to the Brew House (I think that's what it's called) a restaurant/bar a few blocks away that brews its own beer in giant copper vats behind the bar. We sat outside (it was warm) and Byrne and a friend sat right next to us. We were pests, of course. I told him <span class="album">Rei Momo</span> was the best driving tape I had (it's true). He seemed surprised.</p>

<p>I'm trying to learn to play Make Believe Mambo on guitar. Chords are simple but rhythm is hard to get right and keep right.</p>

<p>Some albums I recommend:<br />
Eno/Cale, <span class="album">Wrong Way Up</span>. SO beautiful. Songs, not ambient. As catchy as a Beatle record. Really.</p>

<p>The Clash: <span class="album">London Calling</span>. A perfect album.</p>

<p>The most recent Outkast record. I know everyone has heard it, but it really is that good.</p>

<p>The first Steely Dan album, <span class="album">Can't Buy A Thrill</span>. Not like their later stuff. Real rock music, complex, witty, weird. Just because they left it behind doesn't mean we have to.</p>

<p>Anything you find on Ralph Records, not just the Residents. Snakefinger was good (the song Here Comes The Bums is like a 3-minute Tim Burton movie or a recurring bad dream where you're trapped in a cartoon).</p>

<p>I'll think of more later, I'm sure. <span class="edNote">[editor's note: your recommendations are filed. Thanks a bunch!]</span></p>

<p>Ahh, I'll never forget October 9, 2004; the day when I, Fernie Canto, watched Mr. David Byrne play, in my own hometown. It was only the second concert I ever attended, and it left me in such a huge state of euphoria, I don't think I got over it yet. The man was so full of energy, the show was so explosive, the music was so magnificent, everything was just in the perfect measure, I think it's hard to beat that show. I don't think I'd have enjoyed a classic Stones or Who concert more than this one. The <em>atmosphere</em> of the concert was pretty much unbeatable. This man seems enlightened, I don't know. I guess I just like him too much. At this moment, I could say he's my favourite artist, as much as my like Peter Gabriel, Brian Eno, Jean Michel Jarre or that rich, pompous Mike Oldfield who's more full of himself than the world's fattest self-cannibal (though I still like him (Mike Oldfield, not the world's fattest self-cannibal, that is (nested parentheses are great, man)). ... ).</p>

<p>But like I said, David Byrne's show was amazing. And when I got <span class="album">Grown Backwards</span>, I was... a little underwhelmed. Why, you may ask? Well, I don't really know. I think the album was just too relaxed and understated, <em>quite</em> different from the show. It didn't attend my expectations, to be brutally honest. But the problem was that <em>I was expecting the wrong thing</em>. Once I took the album as a relaxed, understated one, I was... erm, the term "blown away" is so overused, but I think it's accurate. This album <em>is</em> quiet, tame and understated, but it's also playful, friendly, subtle, and filled to the brim with melodies and unexpected, diverse instrumentation and arrangements! Yeah, that's right! You can close your eyes and put your finger on any random song out of the 14 presented here, and you can be sure that it has a great, memorable melody, but you'll never know if you'll find the Tosca Strings, a brass section, a samba-like rhythm, Theremins, prepared pianos, tribal-like percussions, a funky drum rhythm or a small orchestra playing an aria from a Bizet or Verdi opera! That's how cool the album is.</p>

<p>Seriously, pretty much every song is a small gem, in a way. And the mood and instrumentation faintly reminds me of Brazilian performers like Caetano Veloso. No doubt he was inspired by them; see, the percussionist is Brazilian! But anyway, if you think Mr. Byrne is only good when being "paranoid", "silly" or "nerdy", I recommend you this one. It's a truly 'human' album, and even the two arias - 'Au Fond du Temple Saint', from Bizet's "Les P&ecirc;cheurs de Perles", and 'Un di Felice, Eterea', from Verdi's "La Traviata" - reflect that, somehow. Maybe you could trace some sort of bigger meaning or concept on these songs, what with the album title, but I'm not sure. Me, I just love these two arias, and I'm not even a great fan of Opera, in general. 'Au Fond du Temple Saint' has secondary vocals by Rufus Wainwright, and a load of instruments: strings, woodwinds, harp, euphonium, prepared piano, Theremin, marimba, making quite a sort of "chamber orchestra". 'Un di Felice, Eterea', on the other hand, is gentler, and certainly gorgeous. I was blown away when David Byrne sang this one live. I didn't know he was such a brilliant <em>singer</em>, really, but he is.</p>

<p>Everywhere else, the only song that wasn't written by him is 'The Man Who Loved Beer', and it gains a wonderful arrangement here. And then, there's lots of Byrne for ya. Favourites of mine? Ehhhnn... Man, where do I start? Should I mention the sublime 'Empire' and its fantastic, lush arrangement for horns? Or should I mention the waltzy 'The Other Side Of This Life', or the soft samba 'Tiny Apocalypse'? That's difficult! These songs are all good. Perhaps, David loses it a bit when he gets too dependant on those silly one-note melodies on 'Pirates', but it has a cool beat and fun vocal delivery, which makes it better than John Lennon's 'Julia'. But the soft ballad 'Why' is utterly gorgeous, and the aforementioned 'Empire' is just as much. In a slightly more energetic note, you have 'Dialog Box', and... Argh!</p>

<p>Look, just let me mention the opening 'Glass, Concrete &amp; Stone', and its shivery tribal beat, the mellow cello and marimba and David's dreamy melody. That's a wonderful song! Softer spots are the funny 'She Only Sleeps', the also funny 'Civilization', 'Astronaut' and its <em>great</em> Theremin ensemble, and even the short, silly 'Glad' wins me over. See what I mean when I say <em>all</em> these songs are good? Just listen to them yourself. Of course, you might not like these songs as much as I do if you don't like the style, but <em>why</em> would you dislike the style?</p>

<p>Oh, yes, and there is a bonus track here: The fifteenth track, 'Lazy', which is not "part" of the album, but is inserted here as an addendum. It's a song that David co-wrote with X-Press 2, and this version is based on a remix someone did. So, he uses his trusty back-up musicians, as well as the Tosca Strings, to perform a majorly interesting rendition of the remix. And the song is great, if you ask me! My sister even recognised it when I was listening to it, once. But anyway, <span class="album">Grown Backwards</span> gets a solid 10 from me - if only for the fact that I can't find any faults in it. Yes, a 10. A 10 for <em>you</em>, Mr. David Byrne, and all the cool guys that played with you. And thanks for bringing such a magnificent show to my town, and giving me the opportunity to watch it. I might have handled my money incompetently when I bought the ticket, but it was damn worth it. And it's a shame that the record company owners and businessmen are getting most of the money I paid for your new album, but if you get one cent out of it, I'll be happy.</p>

<p>PS: By the way, should I comment one little thing about the show? His performance of 'And She Was' was excellent! I could finally understand why people like it so much, and I realised one of the reasons why I don't like the album version: it's that stupid, tingly arpeggio that runs all through it! On the show, there was only the fun bass line, and I realised the song it pretty good! I still don't like the album version, though. Same applies to 'Road To Nowhere' - except that I <em>like</em> the album version. But the show version was still better!</p>
