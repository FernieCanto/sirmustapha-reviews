<p>Electronic music evolved and became an incredibly complex universe, and possibly following the breakneck speed of the technological development, it spawned hundreds of genres, sub-genres, sub-sub-genres and whatever else in a matter of just decades. Not only the club-going enthusiasts were demanding more and more music and more and more <em>kinds</em> of music, but the artists wanted to (and still want to!) please people, not only the "masses", but usually "niches"; so delving into those genres will reveal a load of bizarre things. The problem I have with that ultra-micro-specialisation is that usualy you'll find many artists who make ONE kind of music and one kind ONLY... basically the same as with metal bands, right? And I prefer a lot more the artists who blur those lines, who mix up styles, ignore the notion of "genres" and challenge every pre-conceived notion and every easy label. Boards of Canada are masters at that: what they do is just THEIRS, virtually impossible to immitate, and the only way you can try to pigeonhole them is to define them as simply Boards of Canada.</p>

<p>In theory, however, their music is very simple and maybe even gimmicky. What they do is to use their arsenal of hardware and software to create old music. But I'm not talking about old genres or "retro" music, no: I'm talking about music that sounds old, musty, moldy and faded, more specifically that sounds like it was made for 70's educational videos and TV documentaries. The name of the band was taken from the National Fim Board of Canada, and yes, the two musicians &mdash; Michael Sandison and Marcus Eoin &mdash; watched a lot of that stuff. In a way, this band does something that I am absolutely obsessed with: I <em>LOVE</em> old stuff, but old stuff that <em>sounds like</em> old stuff, and they are masters at doing that, not only through the music, but even the artwork. It's a shame that I was not raised on the same stuff that these guys loved, so it's not very "in context" in my case, but the result is still fascinating. The band's overall sound is based on fluttery analogue synth sounds that are often filtered, twisted, bent out of tune or subjected to "wow and flutter" effects, overdriven and saturated. Those haunting melodies and atmospheres are countered by rhythms that are either contemplative and wandering or choppy and complex, and the seasoning comes in the shape of vocal samples and other synth peppering, that also undergoes the same treatments. They really go to great lengths to deform the sound to their will, and the result is tremendous. But the best thing is that it's not at all a gimmick: they really go straight towards the beauty of that sound, and the songs are beautifully written and constructed to the point that the songs don't <em>depend</em> on those tricks.</p>

<p>Michael and Marcus are actually brothers, and they concealed that fact for some time to avoid comparisons to Orbital. They have released relatively few albums and a fair number of EP's and other releases. This won't be a comprehensive page, but I'll try to cover as much material as I can. Their albums, at least, are all here, and whether you want to chase their assorted releases and rarities, it's up to whether you really dig their sound or not. If you're too impatient for that, stick to their albums; they're great.</p>

Music Has the Right to Children
1998
[s]Roygbiv[/s], [s]Bocuma[/s], [s]Telephasic Workshop[/s], [s]Aquarius[/s]
<p>Boards of Canada's first full length LP is a truly seminal release and caught the world by surprise. Of course, the seeds of this album had already been planted in MANY older releases &mdash; releases that include the EPs and singles released on the band's own label Music70 as well as the EXTREMELY obscure tapes and records that can only be heard by downloading the MP3's via torrent or Soulseek or something like that. The ideas for these songs and the overall sound were not created overnight: they're the result of years of experimenting and active work, but the genesis of the very thing that the world came to know as <em>Boards of Canada</em> is condensed and perfectly captured in this very record. Just looking at the artwork gives you a pretty good idea of the album's mood and sound: old and weathered, but also beautiful and peaceful. Yeah, the "70's educational videos" sound may freak you out a little bit, but if you relate this record to childhood memories and nostalgia, then this album overall reflects the <em>positive</em> memories.</p>

<p>As for the tracks, the folks alternate short pieces and vignettes with the longer compositions. To be quite brutally frank, I find the shorter songs more interesting than the longer pieces &mdash; not necessarily <em>better</em>, but more interesting, and I kind of wish they'd included <em>more</em> of them here. The reason is that, in the short tunes, they're willing to take more risks, to explore the sound, as they're not at all required to stablish a mood or a groove, and can just play along freely. Take, for example, the wonderous [s]The Color of the Fire[/s], which has a sample, taken from <em>Sesame Street</em>, of a young girl speaking "I love you" in many different intonations. The recording is fed through strange filters and echo effects, and it's laid over a saturated, overdriven electric piano sound playing little figures that remind me of those things they play over TV slides or radio intermissions or things like that. You must hear it to believe it. Likewise there is the "ambient" [s]Wildlife Analysis[/s], with an analogue synth soloing over the floating synth chords; [s]Triangles and Rhombuses[/s] is a little slow groove with a bass line and a sparse rhythm (it ends with a short vignette features in [a]Twoism[/a]: a tune that, to me, sounds like the musical representation of an old, blurry, uncertain childhood memory, that features just a few slightly dissonant chord changes and a fluttery, almost Mellotron like melody line). There are three tracks in the middle that form a sort of "suite", that is, by far, my favourite portion of the record. [s]Kaini Industries[/s] is just about 30 seconds long, and it feaures just a snaking, syncopated synth melody ending on a field recording of a native tribe playing; [s]Bocuma[/s] takes over with an incredible synth riff &mdash; the combination of melody and synth tone is brilliant, and it goes on for about two minutes with a sinth solo on top. This would sound pretty much perfect as a background music for those interludes between school programmes in British channels &mdash; and, actually, I <em>did</em> hear an YouTube montage that put exactly that tune on the "clock" vignette from BBC Schools. Then, [s]Roygbiv[/s] (yeah, that is the color spectrum mnemonic!) kicks off with a bass riff and sets up a wonderful, beautiful groove. The only problem with this suite is that it's too short! I wish THESE songs were longer, but, yeah, they sound gorgeous just the way it is. Another brilliant moment is the closing [s]One Very Important Thought[/s], that has mostly a looping synth melody with a TV recording of a female voice advising the viewers to be careful when being jurors on censorship cases ("obscenity cases"), which could be restricting the people's freedom to think and speak. The effect it has on the album is wonderful &mdash; it <em>really</em> does feel as an added-on "coda" for the whole show.</p>

<p>I won't say the rest of the record is less interesting than that, because some songs are truly beautiful. I'm a fan of [s]Aquarius[/s], with its contemplative "watery" chords and samples recorded from <em>Sesame Street</em>. This is easily one of the highlights here. Another definitive highlight is [s]Telephasic Workshop[/s], with a complex, syncopated groove with sparse synth backing underneath it. The rhythm starts getting thicker and thicker, however, and not with synthetic percussion, but with chopped up samples of speech, that very gradually create a truly engulfing web of rhythm, and before you realise it, you're absolutely <em>inside</em> it. The effect is truly incredible. <em>An Eagle in Your Mind</em> also features a bit of those chopped, complex rhythmic effects, but the focus is more on the haunting, mysterious synth chords and sounds. Beautifully atmospheric, I say; and the same applies to [s]Turquoise Hexagon Sun[/s], that features mostly a gentle, nearly na&iuml;ve electric piano tune and a tapestry of vague, distant sounds and percussion effects. I like it! And [s]Open the Light[/s] is also beautiful, featuring no percussion, and with a sound that, for me, evokes perfectly the sound of nostalgia. It's beautiful, uplifting, but it sounds like constantly longing for something.</p>

<p>Some other songs don't catch my ears so fiercely, even when they do feature some interesting tricks; [s]Smokes Quantity[/s] has a "wow and flutter" effect applied to its synth backins that make it sound like the tape is <em>really</em> worn out, but the effect is a lot less mature than the band would eventually achieve. The songs are still beautiful, however, and the album as a whole is still positively grand. Maybe it's a <em>little bit</em> too "mood piece" at times to my tastes, but the highlights just keep coming, and the product is absolutely unique and a necessity for any person interested in electronic music.  If you want just one Boards of Canada album and aren't willing to take any risks, get this one; but you wouldn't be crazy to want just one, would you?</p>

<p>[a]Music Has the Right to Children[/a] might have taken the world by surprise, but I doubt that anyone could be prepared to <em>this</em>. The least tolerant critics may be willing to say that it's just a copy of the previous albums, while the more zealous appreciators will point out that this record is pretty much <em>the opposite</em> of its little brother: while that one was bright, bluish, and very soothing and gentle overall, [a]Geogaddi[/a] is dark, ominous, treacherous and unforgiving. I say, this isn't just the "evil twin" of [a]Music Has the Right to Children[/a], but is <em>a real beast</em> of the album. If you think you've heard creepy, scary music, just wait until you hear this! Death metal? Black metal? Dark ambient? Pfah! We're not talking about obvious and unsubtle "BOO! MADE YOU JUMP!" works, but an album that, at times, seems to be concealing something mean and threatening, and at other times is simply digging deep into your nightmares and pulling out everything you fear the most.</p>

<p>Now, I may be exaggerating a bit here, but there are two factors to be considered here: first is that the nostalgic, weathered and blurry sounds the band likes to much certainly has a side evoking the na&iuml;vety of childhood, but it has this side of bringing out something frightening and mysterious that you can only catch a fleeting glimpse of, with the corner of your eye, without ever being able to put your finger on it now (the child is gone, the dream is gone, IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII have become comf't'bly numb, DURRR DUUUUUUUUURRRR DUUUUU-UUU-UUURR DUUUUUURRRR *ahem*), like static-laden recordings of Numbers Stations, warped and chewed tape recordings that you have no idea where they came from, strange self-hypnosis recordings and <em>plenty</em> of references to occultism, mathematical concepts, religious groups and the number 666; the second is that, well, I despise the idea of watching a film, going on an amusement park ride, listening to a song or doing any activity in order to <em>be scared</em>. I mean, really? Feeling fear in a controlled environment? That idea doesn't thrill me at all. There are things in <em>real life</em> that scare the shit out of me, and I have no reason to emulate that feeling in a false, fabricated environment. I like horror films when they are well done, entertaining and interesting, but not for being "scary". I like music for the same reasons, and I don't care if it's "scary" or not, and being scared by music makes even less sense than being scared by a film. Yet, this album has a tremendous power in me. It's not "scary" in the sense that it makes me feel fear or that makes me jump out of my chair, but it seems to <em>embody</em> a dangerous, powerful sensation that is very, very hard to capture. Its power, mostly, lies in its subtlety: there are no booming, distorted chords, no disturbing samples of horror films or of serial killers describing murders in cold detail, no synth lines distorted all the way to oblivion or anything like that. Instead, Michael and Marcus indulge in manipulated and damaged samples of strange origins, backwards recordings, sounds that seem to come from tapes that are melting away as they're playing, alarming chord changes, noises and tunes that are under the threat of being defaced by horrible dissonance. Not to mention that the band didn't even take these "secret messages" seriously at all: at times, they were just taking the piss, and at other times, they were just creating beauty in the studio. There is no purpose of controlling people's minds and making Boards of Canada fans go out on the streets carrying machettes killing random people and offering their blood to Satan, and it's exactly <em>that</em> lightheartedness that makes the album even more powerful &mdash; if that even makes any sense.</p>

<p>In short, I love this album. This is where the Sandison brother take their skills and knowledge to its very extremes. The longer songs are all extremely interesting and atmospheric, and the short vignettes are even more intriguing and bewildering than in the previous album. On top of that, the album is <em>FILLED</em> with hidden samples, details, codes, recordings taken from goodness-knows-where. In short, there is so many things to look out for here, that four or five listens are nowhere <em>close</em> to sufficient. Let's start with the longer tracks? What about [s]Gyroscope[/s], with a claustrophobic ambience coupled with a relentless, hypnotic drum loop, which barely buries a recording from a Numbers Station &mdash; not just <em>any</em> Numbers Station, but a particularly creepy one that features a little boy's voice reciting the numbers. Eek! This song is a fine example to demonstrate the real mood of this record. But there is more! [s]Sunshine Recorder[/s] has a downtempo, stuttering rhythm and a curious filter effect applied on a synth; the atmosphere feels like being lost somewhere, not somewhere scary and frightening, but just somewhere you want to get out of. [s]Julie and Candy[/s] has the brothers playing a complex, jungle-like layer of recorders and flutes over a more trip-hoppy backdrop. One fine example of their sound destruction techniques involve using the microphones on a double tape deck system to create an "echo bouncing" effect; an idea similar to Brian Eno's "Frippertronics", but in a smaller, more "lo-fi" setting. I like it. [s]Alpha and Omega[/s] is arguably the album's "epic", a highly rhythmic song with faux-Eastern rhythms and instrument samples and an absolutely amazing pattern on a fat, analogue synth tone. This sounds like an amazing soundtrack for a forest ritual or something like that: it grooves and shakes like mad, and goes through all those dark, shadowy regions I like so much. Likewise there are other wonderous tracks like the fluttery, bubbly [s]1969[/s] (with vocal samples referring to the Branch Davidians); the initially pleasant [s]Music Is Math[/s], which devolves into strange dissonance at the end; the beautiful, almost peaceful [s]The Beach at Redpoint[/s] and its flute-y "coda" [s]Opening the Mouth[/s]; [s]Dawn Chorus[/s] and its strange female voices; and [s]You Can Feel the Sky[/s] and its nearly oppressive, hushed sound and a strong, remarkable percussion pattern.</p>

<p>The short songs are a spectacle apart, however. The band is willing to go to surprising extremes, even including a freaky collage of voice samples and musical snippets called [s]A Is to B as B Is to C[/s] (a mysterious reference to the Golden Ratio), showing the band is quite in touch with tape experimentations and montage. On the other hand, you get an oddity like [s]Dandelion[/s], which features a tiny little electric piano tune played <em>entirely backwards</em> and repeated many times, and interspersed with Leslie Nielsen narrating a National Geographic documentary. [s]Beware the Friendly Stranger[/s] shall be very familiar to fans of David Firth &mdash; it's the "theme tune" of Salad Fingers, no less! And Firth couldn't have chosen a more fit tune: the meandering flute-like tune backed only by what sounds like a crackling fire doesn't really evoke something very friendly and welcoming. Another interesting item is [s]Energy Warning[/s], that consists of a voice over from a TV advert about energy conservation played over a strange, grainy musical background. But there are really lots of interesting spots like that, along with very beautiful little tunes (such as the simple and gorgeous [s]Over the Horizon Radar[/s], the eerie [s]In the Annexe[/s] and the soothing, droning [s]Corsair[/s] that closes the album).[/s] As for [s]Magic Window[/s], it's not actually a song: on the vinyl issue, the "track" is an entire blank side with a simple carving of a family, and on the CD, it consists of 1 minute and 46 seconds of <em>absolute silence</em>; and the length was carefully chosen to make the whole album last exactly 66&prime;6&Prime; (that is counting also the 2 seconds pregap that every Red Book CD contains). Huh? Huh?? That idea was actually taken from a joke made by Steve Beckett, owner of Warp Records, but considering that there are already several obscure and strange "messages" hidden all over the album, it's easy to see why the brothers decided to carry on with the idea.</p>

<p>Say what you will, that [a]Music Has the Right to Children[/a] is the band's definitive masterpiece and this is a mere copy. I understand that sentiment, but [a]Geogaddi[/a] is <em>easily</em> my favourite Boards of Canada release. It is excellent from start to finish: not a single second comes across as an anti-climax and not a single track here gets anywhere close to being a duffer. Of coure, I don't want to convince you <em>not</em> to pick up the previous record: they are <em>both</em> essential and <em>both</em> necessary. Make no mistake: get both records and THEN choose your favourite. I guarantee that your "non-favourite" will not accumulate much dust.</p>

<p>In interviews and articles all over the Internets, you'll see that the band was starting to get pissed off by seeing their whole sound reduced to "downtempo triphop beats with child voices", and decided to change. Change, baby, change! Of course, their change wasn't exactly welcome by many of their diehard fans, who kept asking "WHERE ARE THE FUZZY ANALOG SYNTHS AND THE CHILDREN'S VOICES AND WHY ARE THERE SO MANY GUITARS???????!?!?!?!?", but I am not a diehard fan and you should know that.</p>

<p>So, are <em>those</em> the changes here? Yeah, basically: they got rid of the strange and mysterious samples, they severely diminished the number of short vignettes (and the short tracks that are here are very, very slight), the songs are a lot more in the "ambient/trip-hop" camp (though NOWHERE as stereotyped and obvious as those labels suggest) and there are guitars in these songs &mdash; as in straight, unaffected and undistorted guitars! Both acoustic and electric! Go figure. What bothers me is that this "change" may be the ultimate demonstration of the nasty effects of the desperate attempts at pigeonholing such unique artists as the Sandison brothers: you get two guys who are interesting in making <em>their own</em>, uncomprimised music, and what do people do? Call it "trip-hop with children's voices"! And what does the band do? Take a completely new approach to music making in order to show they are much more than that. As such, this change may sound a little desperate, a "trying too hard" affair. But is it really such a problem?</p>

<p>Not really: the use of guitar is intelligent and inspired, the "ambient/trip-hop" is compensated with the band's usual sensitivity for good music, the lack of vignettes is compensated by really well done tracks, and the samples aren't terribly missed here. But if I have to make a final judgement, I say that this album isn't as good as [a]Music Has the Right to Children[/a]... but then again, what is? I don't think [a]The Campfire Headphase[/a] is a masterpiece, but I won't constantly while and bitch and moan about how this album isn't a carbon copy of their previous records &mdash; that is exactly what the band was trying to evade! It's silly to criticise album for not being what the band <em>didn't want</em> it to be, right? On the other hand, it's fair to criticise the album for not being as good as it could be, and... yeah, some songs here sound quite lacklustre. The spark of creativity and imagination that was so abundant in the previous records is sort of lacking here. But then, just keep in mind that both [a]Music Has the Right to Children[/a] and [a]Geogaddi[/a] were the results of YEARS of music making, and the band had tons of material to use in the records. With this change in style, it's possible that the folks didn't have as much material to choose from here. In this way, [a]The Campfire Headphase[/a] may be Boards of Canada's sophomore slump arrived one album too late... but I hate using terms such as "sophomore slump", so screw that.</p>

<p>What about the <em>songs</em>, dammit? Some are really great, some are just so-so. It pains me to call these songs "so-so", but, dammit, there is plenty of great stuff in here! [s]Chromakey Dreamcoat[/s], that opens the album after the short and forgettable vignette [s]Into the Rainbow Vein[/s], has an AMAZING effect on a repetitive guitar loop, making it sound like a <em>really</em> old and damaged recording from the 70's or something; and the whole song that comes off it is just very beautiful and atmospheric, and it has a gorgeous piano coda too!
