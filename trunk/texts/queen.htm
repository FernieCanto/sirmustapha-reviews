<p>I must admit. I love Queen. Not really in the "Wow, Queen are so great, they are the bestest band ever" way, but as in... these guys have a very special place in my heart. After all, it was through Queen that I got seriously into Rock music, and that really changed my life. Maybe I don't love this band today as much as I once loved it, but I still love Queen, and that's a fact...</p>

<p>Having said that, I must express my opinions: Queen are both overrated and underrated. Yeah, you know: Queen is <em>Queen</em>, and there are lots of people who love these guys to the ground, and consider them the best thing since sliced bread. 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. 'We Are The Champions'. 'Somebody To Love'. All those song titles say something to you, don't they? Yeah, they're quite overrated. I know, I know, <em>every</em> band has its share of fans that treat them like demi -gods, but with Queen, the situation seems to be a little more serious. It's not rare to see people who are stuck in their little world, where Queen is all that has ever existed, and all other bands are crap.</p>

<p>Probably because of that, many people tend to neglect Queen. People dislike Queen more than they should, because let's face it: Queen weren't just good, or important. They were a <em>great</em> band, and once you give up all your prejudices and sink into their music, you can find lots of great things. Still, people dismiss the band, and refuse to think twice as soon as they hear the name "Freddie Mercury". And actually, you don't hear much about Queen, these days. Few people seem to know Queen beyond the barrier of 'I Want To Break Free'.</p>

<p>Anyway, sorry if I sound defensive. But I can't help it. I really, really like Queen. These guys were unique, and I doubt anyone can fully immitate their style. Mostly because, contrary to what people seem to think, Queen <em>wasn't</em> Freddie Mercury and Freddie Mercury only. They were a blend of <em>several</em> things. Just as Freddie provided the Operatic touches, the piano and the mocking pompousity, there was Brian May's taste for hard rock and complex guitar work, and there was the brilliant rhythm combo of John Deacon and Roger Taylor. While these two guys weren't some of the <em>best</em> musicians ever, they were darn unique. Roger could blast out a classy drum line and even supply a set of simple, but effective drum fills; and John Deacon sure knew how to use his bass guitar along with Freddie's piano. Brian May is one of my favourite guitarists ever, along with Mike Oldfield, and I do think he's rather underrated. His technique of layering dozens of guitar lines was something quite innovative, and his playing style is also something special. Like Mike, he has a sense of melody when doing his solos, and never goes beyond the mark. And then, there's Freddie... but you know all you have to know about this guy. I really like his singing, especially in the 70's era. In the 80's, his voice acquired a sharper, slightly hoarse quality - probably due to his age - and I prefer his silky, humourous voice from the <strong>A Night At The Opera</strong> days. But Queen is much bigger than the sum of its components. So let's move on, before you and me get bored.</p>

</p>

</ol>

<p>In their first LP, Queen gathered up songs they wrote over three years. And, like most "humble beginnings" of famous bands, the album doesn't sound like their "classic" sound. If you are used to the Operatic song format, with millions of vocal harmonies everywhere, loud pianos and guitar harmonies, be aware that this album only brings a <em>tiny bit</em> of those influences. Early in their career, their sound was much more simple and straightforward - bringing that Zeppelin-like heaviness and murkiness everyone knows so well. However, you can detect traces of complexity forming here, so you can quickly nod and affirm, "yes, this <em>is</em> the same Queen." Unfortunately, the album sounds horribly dated, thanks to that muddy production. The drums suffers a lot from that. But I don't care much about production, anyway.</p>

<p>And so, these songs can be somehow separated into the "more complex" ones and into the "more simple" ones; as much as I hate separations, anyway. None of those 10 songs ever became a radio hit (at least like future Queen hits), and that's a shame, because several songs on here are quite standouts. 'Keep Yourself Alive' <em>was</em> a kind of "minor hit" for Queen, and deservedly so. Brian plucks away a one-note riff at one time, and a complicated, but catchy riff in another, and the whole band plays this upbeat pop tune with nifty vocal harmonies in the chorus, and some dandy fine instrumental breaks. Brian is already exposing his strange guitar sounds (remember, "nobody played synthesizer") already, and a taste for multi guitar layers, too. Still, this is more like a great pop song rather than an "absolute Queen masterpiece", even if I think it deserved more attention than it got. 'Son And Daughter' is a stab at that slow, murky, bass-driven heavy rock song, with a cool, groovy riff, and an awesome use of vocal harmonies in that "I! WANT! YO-OU! To be a woman!" You don't see things like that everyday, you know. This one didn't get much attention, probably because everyone was sick of Zeppelinish heavy rock songs already in 1973.</p>

<p>Other tunes are also quite nice. 'The Night Comes Down' is this pleasant little acoustic-guitar-driven ballad that begins and ends with a spooky guitar line going up and down, and 'Doing All Right' keeps changing from a little piano ballad into a power-chord fast heavy rocker, and dates back to the age when the band had Tim Staffel and no Freddie Mercury or John Deacon, and was called "Smile". Yup, you can see Staffel's writing credit for that one. And Roger Taylor's first composition, 'Modern Times Rock 'n' Roll' is a short fast rocker that I would call a parody on Punk Rock if Punk Rock already existed in 1973. No great shakes, you know...</p>

<p>About the "more complex" songs? Well, coincidence or not, they're all Freddie compositions. Yeah, while they aren't songs that can go up to the heights of 'Bohemian Rhapsody' or 'Killer Queen', but don't be frustrated! These songs are really <em>great</em>, and majorly fun! Even though I can't enjoy 'Liar' very much. Heck, not even I can explain it myself. I guess it's that production that reduces the impact of the song, and makes it more annoying than entertaining. But you can't miss all those tricks, those guitar lines, those mini solos, the mini-opera sections and all. I particularly like the part when it turns <em>really</em> hard and groovy more or less halfway through. Very, very cool playing, especially when John bashes those loud, distorted bass notes. The other two are just brilliant: 'Great King Rat' is the best of them, incredibly entertaining with its upbeat, marching rhythm, frenetic singing, brilliant guitar solos by Brian and a very intelligent structure that doesn't reach to be "complex" whatsoever. It flows very seamlessly and natural. 'My Fairy King' pushes it on the "opera" direction, heavily piano driven, switching between fast and slow, quiet and loud as fast as a blink of the eye. And it's gorgeous, with the lyrics hitting the "fantasy" level, but not sounding really annoying. It's all about the playing, you know! My favourite part is Freddie's piano solo part near the end, and the way it takes off into a tense, heart-wrenching build-up towards a not so climatic end. Beautiful stuff.</p>

<p>There's also the novelty 'Jesus', a gospel-like song that's way too annoying to my tastes, and completely overdoes the loud, hard-rockin' middle break. Dunno, I just never liked it too much, and even the verses are a tad overbearing. Oddly enough, the album closes with what would become the band's first big hit in the next album: 'Seven Seas Of Rhye', albeit in the shape of an one-minute instrumental tune. Strange. Either way, be sure not to miss this album. If you like Queen, don't be afraid picking this record up. It's great. Plus, it's just so fun to see Queen forming their own style. And be sure to get the vinyl, if you can. The back cover, filled with band photographs, was almost cut in half to fit in the CD booklet. Bah. You don't even get to see the photo of the drummer doll! Did you see that one, right in the middle of the back cover? Do you know why it appears there twice? Because it's a 3D picture! No kidding! Try it out, if you can.</p>

<p>This album here gives you the clear idea that Queen, at this moment, didn't know <em>exactly</em> which way to go. In one hand, they had the "complex" approach of Freddie Mercury, and in the other hand, they had the "dark rockin'" approach of Brian May. As a result, this album is divided in two: the "white side", almost completely written by Brian, and the "black side", entirely written by Freddie Mercury. This might have not been the most intelligent decision they ever did, but the final result happens to be my favourite Queen album ever.</p>

<p>Be aware that this is not a "great" Queen album, not their most essential album. The band isn't focusing their skills into something specific, and as a result, the album can sound a bit messy and hodge-podgey for some people. But for me, however, this is the most proverbially <em>perfect</em> Queen album in existence. The style here isn't very much different from <strong>Queen</strong>, but the band polishes their playing and songwriting skills quite a lot (no more patchy affairs like 'Liar', or 'Jesus', for that matter), and their music actually gains a <em>dark</em> quality that you'll never see anywhere else. Plus, saying the production is improved is one major understatement. Also, I think it was nice to give more liberty to the two major songwriters in the band. With a lot of running time in their hand, Brian and Freddie concentrate in writing "mini suites", displaying their unique style and tastes. Freddie bounces and bops everywhere, with his absurdist visions and stories, and all his vocal performances that would make Peter Gabriel proud, while Brian picks up his guitar and blasts out some mean rockers and some pretty ballads, creating the darkest streak of songs in Queen's entire career. I dunno, but I think Brian's side is far <em>darker</em> than Freddie's side, and so, it should be the Black side, not the White side! Oh, well, that naming probably has to do with the song titles, anyway ('White Queen' and 'March Of The Black Queen').</p>

<p>So, I cannot find any other way to review the album than to talk of the two sides separately. Anyway, side A features <em>another</em> Roger Taylor composition, 'The Loser In The End'. Mind you, it's easily the worst track in the record, but it's so retardedly fun and exciting, I can't help loving the guts out of it. Brian blasts out some furious guitar attacks, while Roger bashes the hell out of his drumkit as the song fades out. I love that drumming! But don't try to look for any substantial melody, of course. Just thought I should warn you. Anyway, Brian surely writes some of the best songs in here. To open up the album, he displays his ever increasing skills with creating guitar symphonies in the instrumental 'Procession' - a quite spooky song, actually, that leads into the "magnum opus" of side one, 'Father To Son'. I'm really, really fond of that little "cascade" guitar riff at the very beginning, not just for the unique, "tingling" guitar riff, but for the effect it causes. But don't let that detail fool you: the song is a mean, dark rocker with some of those powerful vocal harmonies, and a bashing crashing instrumental break, where Brian plays some of those tasteful solos that I love. The dark atmosphere of the song engulfs me completely, and it's a good thing that the atmosphere never goes away: the acoustic guitar ballad 'White Queen' is just as dark, and just as beautiful as the previous track. Brian compliments Freddie's singing with some acoustic guitar solos, just before the song builds into the powerful instrumental break. Without letting things get too serious, 'Some Day One Day' presents some cute, gentle balladeering with Brian on the vocals, this time. I like that little guitar riff, and the strange drum patterns Roger plays. Plus, Brian wastes no efforts to show his guitar multi-layering at the end. Just one really nifty pop song that doesn't feel really pop, you know.</p>

<p>Now, if the fans start complaining that everything's just too slow and boring, I just flip the side and show Freddie's most monstrous creation so far in the band's career: 'Ogre Battle' will completely rock your world with its fast, furious guitar riff and Roger bashing the drums as if he was the Devil himself. The meticulous vocal work, the cool vocal harmonies, the guitar noisefests and the intro - that's merely the outro played backwards; man, such a <em>simple</em> trick, how come nobody had ever done that before? - complete the picture, and in my opinion, this single track whips everything from the debut album. But, being Freddie Mercury and all, he presents 'The March Of The Black Queen', that completely puts 'Great King Rat' and 'Liar' to absolute shame. This one is much more clever, exciting and well-written, and I can't help loving every second of its running length to death. Plus, I love that ending! Just as you think everything has just come to an end, with Brian making his guitar hum a funny little melody, the song comes back, and everything runs towards a climatic, grandiose finale! The much shorter 'The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke' still impresses me with that cool harpsichord playing, the millions of voices and harmonies coming from every place at the same time, and the piano at the ending that leads us to the gorgeous ballad, 'Nevermore'. In one minute, it accomplishes everything that other bands would spend <em>seven</em> minutes trying to accomplish, and that's because Freddie displays a deviously untrivial and beautiful melody along the piano playing. Finally, he shows his ability to come up with short, striking pop songs: two of them, actually. 'Funny How Love Is' displays all those vocal harmonies, but still manages to be as pure and catchy as a pop song should be, and 'Seven Seas Of Rhye' holds the record for being the band's first big hit - and deservedly so. The song manages to kick serious butt, and all the guitar lines, the constant stop-and-go, and the fast piano line feel perfectly at ease with the simple, catchy vocal melody.</p>

<p>This record went down as a "minor release" in the band's catalogue, though less "minor" and less overlooked than the debut. It's not hard to see why, but I still think it's quite a shame. The record is better than many people make it seem, even though it's not as "classic" as latter releases, and only barely indicative of the direction the band would take on the very next record. But do check this one out, eventually; if only for 'Ogre Battle'. They didn't do rockers as awesome as that one very often, you know.</p>

<p>Heh, just look at that. This album even sounds like it's their sophomore release, and it's actually their third one. And why? Well, because after two solid, brilliant Queen classics, the album goes on a craze and shoots absolutely <em>everywhere</em>, almost at once; Roger Taylor tracks stumbling upon hard rockers, short tracks of various styles switching at the speed of an eyeblink, operatic bombast, hard rock trashing, a John Deacon composition... all wrapped up on black fabric, beaten with clubs and then dropped on a large disc of black vinyl. Man, if <em>this</em> isn't a hodgepodge of Queen oddities, then nothing is.</p>

<p>Either way, the main rule here is to wipe out all the "darkness" of their sound, and launch headfirst into the tongue-in-cheekiness that's what would turn into their trademark. And in the process, they take their time to do whatever they feel like doing at a particular time. As such, <em>every</em> new track is a left turn this album takes. You can never quite predict what's coming up next, the first time around. And it helps that the songs are all pretty good, so there aren't those unpleasant surprises, or songs that feel like a bucket of cold water after a warm bath. Unfortunately, the overall level of quality dropped a bit from <strong>Queen II</strong>. At least to <em>me</em>. While there are no songs I dislike, it makes less of a consistent, exciting ride. But, well, this is the album that points to the future! A glorious future, that is.</p>

<p>Freddie himself is on a roll, exercising his songwriting muscles nonstop to create a string of excellent and creative songs, most of them already on the operatic vein. The absolute classic here is 'Killer Queen', which he described as the essential Queen song, and it's easy to see why: carefully written down to every single note, and showing their skills with vocal overdubs, tricky song structure and all that stuff. And Brian May gets his chance to shine, playing another of his beautiful guitar solos, and those mini guitar-symphonies as well. The lyrics are no big deal here, but they are on 'Flick Of The Wrist', his vicious dig on the music execs - a theme yet to be revisited on the next album, but here, it's quite cool already; not so poisonous, but freaky and over-the-top in a way only Freddie himself could sing correctly. Musically, it's hard rock, slow and pounding on the verses, fast on the choruses. Unlike anything on <strong>Queen II</strong>, though the sound of the track could definitely be boosted up a bit. More guitar, perhaps. The song is closed with the piano ballad 'Lily Of The Valley', with a good melody but nothing that makes it better than 'Nevermore',for example. And there are the bombastic swells, of course.</p> 

<p>On the more eccentric vein, there's 'In The Lap Of The Gods', in which Freddie takes "bombastic" as an objective. The intro to the song, which crashes in as loudly as it possibly can, is what I could call a blueprint for 'Bohemian Rhapsody', but with much more emphasis on over-the-topness than in stuffing as many voices as possible in one single strip of tape. And it's awesome! In particular the mini-orchestra Brian makes with the guitar. Eventually, the opera fest fades away, and turns into something of a romantic ballad, with Freddie's vocals on the wrong speed, and Taylor belting out some screams. The "revisited" version at the end is something else entirely, like the bitter end of the story began on the first version ("My money, that's all you wanna talk about" - man, that and 'Flick Of The Wrist' on the <em>same</em> album), in which the band pulls the trick of repeating the huge, anthemic, "sing-along" wo-wo-lah-lah-lah chorus over and over and over, until the voices are louder than the speakers can handle, and until there's no more reason to sing the same goddamn chorus, and end with a horribly distorted gong. To me, that always sounded like a parody on anthemic sing-along choruses, but some people might take it seriously. You can do what you want, anyway. Finally, there's the hilarious, hyperactive ragtime 'Bring Back That Leroy Brown', with Brian playing some mean banjo, and plenty of vocals interplay. Just brilliant, man.</p>

<p>Yes, that makes six Mercury tracks on the album, almost half of the thing. There are only four May tracks here, and his reduced participation may be explained by his falling with hepatytis before the sessions began. That might have given Freddie the incentive to start writing more, and it <em>did</em> help Deacon pick up the guitar and deliver his first song, 'Misfire', which is just lovely as hell - much like most of his output with the band. It's short, but it's groovy and catchy, and features <em>plenty</em> of guitar overdubs, which culminates with two guitar choruses dialoguing with each other at the end. Pretty impressive, I say, even if it's only slightly indicative of the songs he was about to come with. Roger Taylor wrote 'Tenement Funster', which begins his "teenager problems" trend. It's a pretty cool, slow, acoustic guitar driven (John again!) rock song. His best so far, in fact. The other non-May song is actually credited to the whole group, 'Stone Cold Crazy', their stab at fast, trashy hard rock. Great riff, very tight playing, but the song as a whole is not very impressive, considering Queen's standards. It's still a welcome addition to the album, and lots of fun.</p>

<p>As for Brian May's compositions, one of them is an absolute ace: 'Brighton Rock', which opens the album, is one of his best moments as a guitarist. The "song" portion of it is absolutely hilarious, with a frenzied, hyperactive rhythm and Freddie throwing out his best vocal intonations to deliver the short story. And then, Brian throws a series of awesome, creative and entertaining guitar solos, which culminates with him using an echo unit so he can play against himself. It's just fabulous how he plays the entire song without ever trying to "show off". It's a big, exciting, stimulating guitar rant. The other songs aren't that good. One of them is the one minute piano lullaby 'Dear Friends', which isn't at all bad, but... eh, you know. The other is the classic, live standard 'Now I'm Here'. You know, at this stage, it sounds rather generic, but it's <em>still</em> a fine, well written rocker. Crowd pleasing fluff? Well, consider me pleased, then. What can I do. It's got cool chord progressions! And those high-pitched whistling-like noises that sound synthesized, but the album clearly states, one again, that no synthesizer was played. It's just Brian's guitar again. And for more guitar freakiness, there's the dark-ish ballad 'She Makes Me', which is pretty strange and beautiful. Brian's vocals are not fantastic, but he does a good job, and the best thing about it is the way Brian holds those weird guitar notes for so long. It's not that I doubt his skill, but it boggles my mind to think he managed that without tape loops or something. Just cool.</p>

<p>I hope I didn't scare anyone with my descriptions of the album as a mess of half-finished songs, because in the end, it doesn't <em>sound</em> like it. Not because it's "accomplished", but because it's <em>fun</em>! This is already a good place to get some of that prime Queen sound, especially if you're one of those who like to follow a band's evolution. Maybe it's not very recommendable for the passing fan, but 'Brighton Rock' is a song you need. And it's not on <strong>Greatest Hits</strong>.</p>

<p>Did anyone say "hodgepodge"? Well, never mind it: as if by accident, the band makes their real magic happen with this album. And what once sounded like a patchwork of separate, small pieces, here becomes a true, seamless masterpiece. All of their different styles and tastes come together to make one of their most famous and well known albums, and one of those "essential" Rock albums, ya know? Well, because you can find here pretty much <em>everything</em> that's good about Queen, at least in their 70's era... err, well, that <em>is</em> pretty mucy everything that's good about Queen, so, um, right.</p>

<p>But what <em>are</em> those good things that you can find here? Say, it's not too far from being an extension of <strong>Sheer Heart Attack</strong>, in terms of material: ragtime, big band, hard rock, opera, music hall, folk, piano balladeering... but everything with a heavy dosage of tongue-in-cheek pomp and self-importance. That, if you wish, is the famous Queen "schtick". That is, if you're willing to call a "schtick" the thing that made Queen really so different and fun. It's up to you. I, personally, don't think they did that just as a "schtick". It's their style, you know; it's their way to do things, and it's the way they do it best. Besides, I can't imagine 'Seasiide Rendezvous' played "seriously", for example. Can you? It would be just ridiculous, and what they do all over this album is turn the ridiculous into awesome;and if you allow my usual bit of personal opinion, they do it in a much more natural, tranquil way than Paul McCartney did in songs like 'Rocky Racoon', for example. Freddie Mercury never expected the entire world to laugh at his humour; he just did whatever the hell he wished to, and here was the place when he truly went into full flight, taking the whole band with him. For one, <em>both</em> Roger Taylor and John Deacon contributed one classic song, each. 'I'm In Love With My Car' is great, with Roger exchanging lines with Brian's guitar like he already did in 'The Loser In The End'. But the music is fun, uplifting, and even though it's slow, it's propelled by Freddie's piano and Brian's guitar in a very cool way. John Deacon, on the other hand, sticks to friendly, cute pop (a sort of trademark) with 'You're My Best Friend', with an effective bit of electric piano. Very catchy song, that! No wonder it was a sort of hit.</p>

<p>But that's not even the tip of the iceberg, you know? This is the album in which both Freddie and Brian go berserk, both with their wicked compositions and with their wild lot of overdubs and recording techniques. Check out Brian's 'Good Company', for example, in which he uses his guitar to simulate horns, "big band" style, backing it all up with an ukelele. Brilliant, masterful playing, and nifty song. His magnum opus, 'The Prophet's Song', is also impressive, with the atmosphere of epic apocalypse <em>perfectly</em> compliemented by a solid, memorable bunch of melodies and an intense performance. And halfway through, Brian brings back the echo unit, with which Freddie makes a sort of vocal version of the 'Brighton Rock' echoed solo. And if Freddie harmonising with himself wasn't cool enough, you get a full-blown vocal harmony making call-and-response with itself. Fans of Brian's "guitar orchestra" will definitely want to hear their rendition of 'God Save The Queen', which is just... the <em>perfect</em> closer to the album, bringing all the over-the-topness to the point of near arrogance. Brilliant.</p>

<p>Freddie doesn't fall behind, and while he didn't invest directly in recording techniques, he was responsible by the trickiest, most twisted songs here. And I'm not even talking necessarily about 'Bohemian Rhapsody' here, which you already know, but I'm more reminded of 'Death On Two Legs', in which Freddie continues his utter destruction of the band's former manager. Lyrically, it's mainly a continuation of 'Flick Of The Wrist', but instead of declaring <em>his</em> suffering, he pretty damns the guy to Hell. And what a cool result that gives us! Freddie sounds <em>really</em> angry here, employing the same "double vocals" trick he used on 'Keep Yourself Alive'. Aside from that, there's the psychotic, wicked intro with the fast piano and all sorts of noises joining in, slowly, in a crescendo. Wow, how <strong>Dark Side Of The Moon</strong>ish - no kidding! And the rest of the song is absolutely manic, with vocal harmonies coming from everywhere at once, guitar solos, and all sorts of cool stuff. As for 'Bohemian Rhapsody', I don't think I have anything really new to say about it; aside from mentioning that, even to this day, it gives me a small bit of nostalgia. You know, it was <em>this</em> song that truly opened my mind to all the great music out there. And, you know, I don't care the least if people complain about it being overplayed, or what. It is a classic, wonderful song, and all the exposure it got was fully deserved. And it isn't even just because of the famous opera mid-section, which features an amazing number of overdubs to create the choral effects. The entire song is beautiful, intelligently written and well performed.</p>

<p>But there's more to the album, you know! I really like all of Freddie's contributions: the short, funny 'Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon'; the famous "romantic" piano ballad 'Love Of My Life', with more of that brilliant guitar work by Brian May and an orchestral harp; and 'Seaside Rendezvous', with an amazingly catchy, clever vocal melody,a stimulating performance and a hilarious break with both Freddie and Roger doing brass sounds with their mouths - must be heard to be believed. As for Brian, he penned the hard rock 'Sweet Lady', which isn't very impressive compared to the other songs, but which does feature some tricky, groovy rhythms dealt mainly by Roger on the drums. It doesn't hurt the experience at all to me, really. But much better is his stab at folk, '39', in which he does some mighty acoustic guitar playing and the lead vocals. Oh, yes, but also very impressive is the way those songs fit together, and feel very complete, overall.This album is almost as cohesive as <strong>Queen II</strong>, and is more than good enough to get a high 14 from me. Please, forget all the hype and get this album when you can. Don't miss the opportunity of having an album that reminds you that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' <em>is</em> and has always been a good song, and that Queen had much more than it.</p>

<p>This is a classic in the true sense of the word. Why wasn´t it given 10?!! <span class="edNote">[editor's note: simply because of my policy of giving only <em>one</em> ten per band, like Mark Prindle and John McFerrin do.

<p>However, after <strong>A night at the opera</strong> they seemed to be on a slow downward spiral and I feel you are being to kind with your ratings for <strong>Hot Space</strong> and <strong>The Works</strong>, which were dreadful. After <strong>Live Killers</strong> (You didn´t review that masterpiece!!) I feel they should have called it a day, rather than release some of the most ugly garbage toward the end.</p>

<p>For some reason, the band turned a bit more mellow, a bit more serious in here. Yeah, a <em>bit</em>; don't expect this to be <strong>Queen II II</strong>, just because of the black cover. But, also, be aware that this album has very, very little to do with its predecessor, much less with races. It seems to be it was given that title just to finish the Marx Brothers reference. The band presents here are more... um, <em>mellow</em> sound, and like I said, a more serious approach. Knowing that Freddie Mercury was still on the band, that means there's <em>a bit</em> of the usual Queen humour is still present, but even that is toned down. Don't ask me why; I have no idea whether there was any specific reason for this change, or they just did that because they goddamn felt like it and nothing more. What matters is that this is still a good offering, and isn't at all dismissable or forgettable.</p>

<p>Okay, it's perhaps not "essential", but it's good. The idea of "continuation" is utterly misleading, though. In the grounds of exploration of the studio possibilities, this album presents us nothing new. There's little to no innovation at all, which means no cool delay effects like in 'The Prophet's Song', or guitar big bands like in 'Good Company'. Oh, yes, and never mind the vocal brasses, the 'Bohemian Rhapsody' operatic passages... Oh, well, the only cool thing that remains here are the rich, super-duper-huge vocal harmonies, and they make their presence on the classic 'Somebody To Love', reportedly Freddie's favourite Queen song. And I can see why. Mind you, I still prefer the tongue-in-cheekiness of 'Bohemian Rhapsody', but it's like choosing barbecue over pizza, mind you. And I mean the original, Latin American barbecue, with raw meat roasting openly over charcoal fire, not that silly grilled thing people do out there. If we weren't talking about <em>that</em> barbecue, I'd easily choose pizza. As for 'Somebody To Love', it's achingly gorgeous, with Freddie taking influences from gospel music to create something of a "sweeping" anthem of love (or lack thereof), which isn't "sweeping" in the cheesy way. It's actually bombastic, but it never escapes the grip of Freddie's writing and performing skills. There's very little guitar in here, in fact, with Brian mainly providing vocals for the choirs (there's more than a plenty of them here), instead. Freddie takes over completely with the piano, and with his singing, of course. It's more than excellent, really. Just outstanding.</p>

<p>My second favourite is 'The Millionaire Waltz', an incredibly entertaining multi-part song, which switches from slow and romantic to trashy and rocking to whatever else you can thing. I especially like the way John plays his bass along to the piano in the beginning. It's amazing how the two instruments go well together - they already did that a bit on 'Love Of My Life', but here it's even more evident. Also, funny is when the whole rock ensemble comes crashing from nowhere at all, and throws the song into an hilarious "carnival music" excerpt, with Brian finally putting his guitar orchestra playing to good use. Brilliant stuff. Even more piano-dominated is 'You Take My Breath Away', an absolutely unusual song in the band's repertoire - imagine 'Love Of My Life' if it was intended as a perfectly serious love song. Well... not exactly. 'You Take My Breath Away' is nowhere as lighthearted, you know. Freddie wastes not a single note on the piano, or on the rich vocal harmonies, or in Brian's guitar interlude. Well, it's just beautiful; I'm not saying it's unusual because I doubted Freddie's talent, but just because it's so down-to-earth and sincere sounding. Oh, of course, then there is 'Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy', which is just fun and catchy; you know, it doesn't show a lot that we haven't seen before, but this is the kind of song that Freddie could write any time of the week, and that'd still result on a great thing.</p>

<p>As for Brian, he only shows some of his rock 'n' roll spirit on the opener 'Tie Your Mother Down', which really gets things going with its almost banal, but clever guitar riff and Freddie's speak-singing over it. It's the kind of dumb rock song that works great on a live setting, but the band really made a great sound on studio, as well. I just have no idea why Brian had to rip-off Led Zeppelin in his guitar solo - you know, there's a bit that came straight from 'What It Is And What It Should Never Be'. But they were great fans of Led Zeppelin, so I think it's more of a direct homage tha plagiarism, and thankfully they chose to "rip-off" one of the very few Led Zeppelin songs that I can stand. On his other songs, he also gets serious... and I admit the results are not so great. And I <em>do</em> like 'White Man', his anti-racism anthem which sounds like a heavier, more serious take at 'The Prophet's Song' wihout the middle section. It sounds a lot like the heavier parts of 'Father To Son', at times, even - and its main riff is used to open the record, in a more bombastic guitar-only version. Hmm... trying to give the album some unity? I wouldn't doubt it - I remember reading that Brian wanted to make something of a conceptual album with the band, while the others would dismiss the idea as too pretentious. Heh, can <em>you</em> imagine an album-length Queen rock opera? I almost wanted to hear that. Anyway, I'm not such a fan of the bombastic ballad 'Teo Torriate', written as a sort of thank you letter for their Japanese fans. It's just a bit too puffed up for its own good. Just a <em>bit</em>, yeah.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there's the delightful 'Long Away', to which he provides lead vocals and a great guitar tone. Very, very beautiful, light-hearted pop song, it has always been a favourite of mine. John Deacon conributes the equally nice, more up-beat and piano based 'You And I', a song I also always liked a lot. This wasn't one of John's biggest hits, but it only shows how his skills were getting better as time went by. It's a very nicely written song. As for Roger, the teenage problems come back again in 'Drowse'. But for that song, he switches to ballad mode to deliver this very slow song, with a stomping timpani, and strange uses of slide guitar and octave singing. Quite an unusual song, as well, but I really, really like it, and I don't care about the sluggishness; that was the desired effect, wasn't it? And the song is very well written, so I have no complaints. The only complaint I can have about the album is its, um, unclear mood; it's at times bright, at times dark, but it never mixes those two moods together in an interesting way like <strong>Queen II</strong> did. But overall, the album is a good, different look at Queen's music, has a fair share of great songs, and... well, it's more consistent than <strong>Sheer Heart Attack</strong>, but it's also less exciting,so they end up with the same rating. Fair, to me.</p>

<p>Did I hear "Arena Rock"? Well, as you may or may not be aware of, it's not really such a stretch to say that Queen were some of the real pioneers of arena rock, starting all that audience participation stuff and such, and whatever goes with it. They were excellent live performers, and their shows were far more raw, heavy and less sofisticated than their studio releases. Perhaps bored of all the endless studio work, the band decided to transfer some of that energy and rawness and lack of sofistication to their next record, and the result is <strong>News Of The World</strong>. Of course,that's not <em>the whole</em> album - Queen had a tradition of pomp to keep up, so you should expect the usual quirkiness normally.</p>

<p>But then, you should also expect the live staples, radio hits and sports events favourites 'We Will Rock You' and 'We Are The Champions', which are placed, back to back, <em>right at the beginning</em> of the record. Not <em>at all</em> a subtle move, you have to agree, but when it comes to these songs, I guess all forms of subtlety must be shot down with extreme prejudice. And that's why I don't like them. Well, well, <em>okay</em>, I do like Freddie's 'We Are The Champions' to some extent - after all, it's a well-written ballad, but I just can't think of it as a song written with the sole purpose of being a well-written ballad and not an anthem for sports teams, with the usual audience participation. As for 'We Will Rock You', it's just primitive, and not in a necessarily good way. This is the kind of stuff that's supposed to really, truly attach the audience to the band, and that kind of stuff, when done with blatantly "Earth-shattering" BLAM-BLAM-Clap! percussion and a melody that even neanderthals are supposed to be able to sing along to, is REALLY not my cup of tea. As such, I solemnly discard the song (except maybe for the guitar solo at the end, which at that point, doesn't even speak so much), and reserve myself the right to utterly despise the boyband reworkings it got a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>But the rest doesn't go so low, fortunately. And perhaps the most remarkable thing about these nine compositions is that TWO of them came from Roger Taylor, and another TWO came from John Deacon. Now, what concerns Roger, these aren't his best songs by quite a fair margin. He picks up the guitar on the two of them, but that doesn't mean much; in particular 'Fight From The Inside' is a rather bland funkish groove, using ugly guitar noises to stand out a little, and falling a bit below par. 'Sheer Heart Attack', which indeed seems to be a reject from the album of the same name, is far more entertaining. At this time, it could be considered as a jab at the punk scene, but that wasn't the song's purpose of existance; but damn, does it fit! A very fast rhythm, with all sorts of obnoxious singing and harmonies (if you're going to call them that!), loud, trashy guitar chords, ear-destructively high pitched noises in the middle break, and an abrupt cut-off at the end that, in such a loud and fast song, causes an effect similar to that of the Beatles' 'I Want You', only about ten times worse. For the record, this is definitely one of the trashiest Queen songs ever, being only rivalled by the heavy-metal 'The Hitman' in 1991. John considerably tones down the album, with two of his nicest, gentlest songs: 'Spread Your Wings', that you can call a "power ballad", but which is a GREAT power ballad in that case,with even a gorgeous guitar solo at the end (go ahead and praise David Gilmour in front of me now if you're really feeling like it), and 'Who Needs You', a fun, Latin-tinged tune with some really good Spanish guitar and a really, really catchy vocal melody that only Freddie Mercury could deliver properly.</p>

<p>Another ballad gets the thumbs-up here, and it's Brian's 'All Dead, All Dead', which is strangely solemn yet understated - kind of like <strong>A Day At The Races</strong> if it weren't so puffed up - counting with some good piano and a <em>wonderful</em> middle break with some of the best use of guitar overdubbing. The compressed sound of guitar even brings to mind the similar things Mike Oldfield did on his first albums, e.g. <strong>Ommadawn</strong>. I have no idea if Brian had been taking his Inspiration&trade; from that source, but if he did, good for him! There can be no such thing as a bad Mike Oldfield influence - at least not in the 70's. As for Freddie, he brings 'My Melancoly Blues', one heck of a funny "drunken" song, with mighty fine piano playing <em>and</em> acoustic bass backing. Whew, that's a whole lot of ballads, isn't it? So much for a "rawer" record, yes, but you gotta remember that the album's "rawness" has more to do with its stripped down sound and production rather than the songs themselves - and THAT those ballads mostly are, indeed. As for sofistication, there's Freddie's 'Get Down, Make Love', certainly one of the strangest odes to sex ever made - so strange that it even sounds like it's talking about something else entirely, at times. Heck, it doesn't sound at all like the stuff Queen made to this point - the actual rhythm is mainly on the loud choruses, in which the whole band comes crashing down, but other than that, it's mostly all down the the sparse pumping rhythm, countered by Freddie's equally sparse piano, and his singing is so over-the-top it's almost hilariously inadequate. And I have no idea if the "wild" instrumental break is predictable or unpredictable - all I know is that it's more like a bad acid trip than what the song actually deals with. Just check out those videogame-like guitar noises! At least the band wants to convice us that those are guitars...</p>

<p>Another track you can call an "oddity" is 'Sleeping On The Sidewalk', which holds a sort of interesting position of being the only real "blues" Queen song to go on one of their official albums - there was the B-side for 'Seven Seas Of Rhye', 'See What A Fool I've Been', which is a rather retarded (perhaps purposefully so) Led Zeppelin homage/rip-off, but it was just a B-side afer all. 'Sleeping On A Sidewalk' fortunately stays away from Led Zeppelin territory, and instead is a faster track with Brian delivering the lead vocals and some cool lead guitar too. I guess the most impressive aspect of it is that it's a live-on-the-studio one-taker, but it's certainly not an "essential" Brian song. Fun, though. 'It's Late', though, <em>is</em> an essential Brian song. For some reason the lyrics were written as a three part play, or something (the verses are "scenes"), but to the music, that's not too important. What matters is that simple-but-cool riff that Brian plays on the guitar, which propels the verses forward, along with nifty syncopated work by the band, countered by a loud, smashing but beautiful chorus, and a really cool instrumental break when the rhythm takes off for good. In essence, it's just a really good rocker, but as far as really good rockers go, I prefer this over 'Now I'm Here', for example.</p>

<p>But that's only one "essential" song, and there aren't many of those here, to be honest. And yes, to me, this is the weakest Queen album so far, though I don't think it's merely due to the lack of "essential" songs. I think it has to do with the whole mood of the band at this point, and I guess, but only guess, that they weren't too satisfied, either. Just check out the following album and see it for yourself. But that could have to do with something else, but I just don't know. All I know is that I'm glad they changed back to their unique, quirky style, instead of dissolving into genericism - a process that's been, well, kind of postponed.</p>

<p>Ah, yes. This is the album that caused some loony RollingStone writer to go on a rant about how Queen was a fascist band. Why? No reason, really. The same rant could be caused by every album up to this point. Not that this album is the same as all Queen album so far, though! It isn't. Yes, it <em>is</em> closer to <strong>A Night At The Opera</strong> than to anything else, since the band decided it was better to return to the mocking, facetious, puffed-up music of yore, instead of the serious tones of <strong>A Day At The Races</strong> or the stripped-bare songs of <strong>News Of The World</strong>. And what do I say? Hooray, I say! Yes, that's right, this is the kind of Queen music that I like the most. While they don't reach the same heights of hyperactive creativity of <strong>A Night At The Opera</strong>, they still managed to <em>stuff</em> the album with nifty music, and some other weird stuff as well. It isn't about the quality of each song individually, but more the fact that they come across as a wholly satisfying and entertaining package.</p>

<p>Also, the <em>sound</em> changed a bit. Something about the production makes the band sound a lot "sharper" and tighter. It's not a universe apart from what they used to sound like, but it's a clear difference. And... well, the music. Great stuff all around. The album is opened by the song with the title I nicknamed myself after, no less, and it's one of the best here, easily. Freddie goes back to his Indian roots, but sets them on top of some heavy, energetic and catchy rock music like only those guys could play. You know, it's not the usual "rocking" kind of stuff: it's the start-and-stop, switch rhythms, call-and-response Freddie Mercury kind of stuff. And it's great! And 'Mustapha' isn't the only one of its kind, here; there's the classic 'Bicycle Race', which in spite of being a bit less entertaining to me, squishes Freddie "epics" of old in barely three minutes. The result is an hyperactive (I've used this word a damn lot, haven't I?) multipart suite with sections that last about twenty seconds each - call-and-response verses, anthemic chorus with Freddie singing about riding his bicycle where he likes, a symphony of bicycle bells and Brian May playing upward scales in stereo. How great is that? I mean, this is one of the band's coolest songs, and it <em>did</em> became a hit; fully deservedly so.</p>

<p>But he isn't any kind of "supreme god" in the album, since Brian also throws in some memorable songs in the stew; among them is the non-hit 'Dead On Time', which is my favourite song on the album, and one of my favourite Brian May songs ever. It's fast, it's energetic, features amazingly tight band work, exquisite machinegun singing by Freddie and the kind of great guitar solos that Brian May's so good at. The bigger hit was 'Fat Bottomed Girl', a far more simplistic raunchy rock 'n' roll song. You know, this is the kind of song that I could simply dismiss entirely if it were performed by some any band out there, but Queen had that sense of irony about them, that made this kind of song worthwhile. There's something about the way Freddie sings it that suggests he <em>doesn't</em> mean any of that, but his delivery is so good, and Brian's guitar so skilled and un-showoffy, that people can just take this as sincere stuff if they wished. Me, I just dig it. There are other great Brian compositions here, anyway, like the ballroom music send up 'Dreamers' Ball', with Brian once again employing his guitar to emulate a bigger set of instruments. And there's something delightfully funny about Freddie singing about dreaming with his loved one after being replaced by someone else. The other song is the nice, soothing, folksy ballad 'Leaving Home Ain't Easy', with yet another weird guitar effect that I suppose is meant to sound like a strings section. Aside from that, it's nothing impressive in Brian's own catalogue, but a fine, welcome addition to the album.</p>

<p>Freddie also presents some material to the ballads department, with the bitter 'Jealousy', in which Brian once again modifies his guitar to give it a sitar-like sound. It's more piano dominated, sounding quite different from the usual tongue-in-cheekiness of 'My Melancholy Blues', for example. But to me, it's John who wins there: 'In Only Seven Days' is as short, sweet and to-the-point as it could possibly be, and in this album, it's almost like a badly needed breather from the endless streak of eccentricity, that doesn't drop at all the level of sofistication. Of course, it's aided by Freddie's nice, steadily-under-the-top delivery and Brian's pad-like guitar effects. John also collaborates with the "crowd-pleasing" 'If You Can't Beat Them', which is probably one of his most simplistic Queen songs. Guess it shows he was much better with the non-trivial pop melodies, but the band manages to maintain the energy level way above the average here. If you want non-trivial pop melodies, better turn to Freddie's own 'Don't Stop Me Now', a fast, jet-engine-propelled piece of piano pop, and one of Freddie's most genuinely downright <em>fun</em> songs. Reportedly, Brian didn't like the song, but that didn't stop him from throwing in a fine, fully adequate guitar solo to make matters even better.</p>

<p>The remaining tracks are kind of strange. 'Let Me Entertain You', the "introduction" to the band, is certainly a very unusual brand of showtune crossed over with hard rock, though it isn't one of Freddie's catchiest songs. As for Roger, he wasn't on the mood for delivering those fun songs about teenage problems, so he comes up with the weird, deranged groove of 'More Of That Jazz', which supposedly brings the small bit of "conceptuality" for the album. Really, it's <em>also</em> not one of his catchiest songs; he repeats the "gimme no more of that jazz" line too often, and his trademark screams start to grate eventually. However, 'Fun It' is quite a thrill, if only because it's so dumb. It's that kind of mechanised groove, with Freddie and Roger switching lines that are not particularly melodic, but the riff that drives it forward makes it worth a listen. Of course, that's <em>me</em>. And I say that no, not every song here is great. But there isn't any song here that I'd completely dismiss. In the end, it's the whole package that counts, and this is the band's most <em>complete</em> and satisfying album since <strong>A Night At The Opera</strong>... and eh, this is the last "classic" Queen album. Doesn't mean "last <em>good</em> Queen album", but... well, this is certainly the last Queen album without synthesizers. You should know what that means.</p>

<p>The new decade only actually began on 198<em>1</em>, but Queen practically has a premonition, here, and the changes start coming. Perhaps fueled a bit by the excitement of recording the <em>Flash Gordon</em> soundtrack, and by the success of the 'Flash's Theme' single, they start kicking in one direction here: 80's slickness! Starting from the very album cover, for goodness' sakes. And just looking at Freddie's short hair and Brian's eyeshades is enough for one to deduce that <em>something</em> has happened. And yep, this is the beginning of an era in which Freddie would compose 50's rockabilly throwbacks on the shower and John would write smash hit singles that would influence <em>Michael Jackson</em>, of all people. Forget about dem Black Queen and White Queen and Killer Queen and all of that. This is the Synthesizer Queen, and afraid that they couldn't state that loud and clear enough, the album is kicked off by a burst of descending, swirling, cosmic noises as if a flying saucer was landing right on your backyard - if you have a backyard, that is, otherwise, you should be well aware that you've got the whole wide world in your yard to explore. In case you didn't know that, you're probably a dunce. Me? I don't have a backyard, really.</p>

<p>As for 'Play The Game' itself, it's probably the <em>last</em> song you'd expect to hear after listening to such an introduction. It's a gentle-and-quiet-vs.-angry-and-loud ballad with the typical Freddie twists, like a darned catchy and untrivial little melody line in the verses, and a lighthearted, sing-along chorus with harmonies and all that. It's pure and absolute Mercury, and the flying saucer noises, even though they don't necessarily <em>enhance</em> the music with their presence, do absolutely no harm. Which is a good sign. Through the album, they are considerably toned down, and surprisingly, the bits that most people think are synthesizers actually <em>aren't</em> synthesizers! A good exaple is John Deacon's first hit single, 'Another One Bites The Dust'. The crazy sounds you hear there are mainly backwards piano chords and treated drums. And if they <em>were</em> synthesizers, they'd be a fine example of synths effectively <em>enhancing</em> a song, since they're there just to give more emphasis to the rhythm in strategic places. And what a rhythm! Funky drums, awesome bass riff, dark atmosphere and... well, just the rhythm section <em>makes</em> the song, but John wasted no efforts in coming up with simple, but memorable vocal lines and lyrics. Great song! John's other song is 'Need Your Loving Tonight', not as memorable and affecting but catchy and enjoyable, and it just kind of follows the footsteps of Freddie's hit single, 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love'. That's a nice one, though it's a bit <em>too</em>sickly sweet for its own good, it's yet a good showcase of the band's versatility and eclecticism - and Freddie's catchy melody lines, of course. And let's face it, it's at least a bit unpredictable that Queen would break it big, in 1980, with a <em>rockabilly</em> single. But that's Queen for ya.</p>

<p>The third Freddie composition, though, is a total bummer to me. Really, it's probably the first Queen song that I <em>genuinely</em> can't stand, and I can say that I tried. It's 'Don't Try Suicide', if you haven't guessed it by the song titles. Not that the wild dynamic shifts and funny bass riff wouldn't make a good Mercury single, but heck, he really overdid himself with coming up with grotesquely stupid lyrics. It sounds silly to complain about stupid lyrics at <em>this</em> point in the Queen page, but this is a case in which the stupid lyrics aren't compensated by anything catchy or clever. It's a by-the-numbers song that bothers me with its intention of being funny. Brian May also overdosed a little on the power ballads a bit, here; 'Save Me' got to the point of being a hit, and it does have a good melody, at least. 'Sail Away Sweet Sister' goes in the sentimental path, with Brian providing the vocals himself (possibly for being highly personal), and I'm always a bit wary of people who deliver highly personal, sentimental lyrics over bombastic power ballads. I don't like it much, but I don't dislike it like I dislike 'Don't Try Suicide'. Brian's other song, though, is a blast! 'Dragon Attack' boasts a super funky, strong rhythm section and a groovy riff. I also like it how each member of the band gets a solo spot, and aside from that, there's a lot of great interplay between them.</p>

<p>Finally, Roger appears with a pair of delightful, catchy rock 'n' roll tunes, like only he could make. Certainly quite a difference from the bitter material on <strong>Jazz</strong> and <strong>News Of The World</strong>, eh? 'Rock It' starts deceivingly enough with a grand, soulful delivery by Freddie over a slow-as-hell guitar arpeggio, but Roger kicks him out with a fast tune, fun vocals and high pitched synth whistles. If anything, this song shows what a good entertainer he could be when he wanted to. And 'Coming Soon' has a certain "new wavey" sound about it, breezy vocals, steady rhythm and all. It's a quite simple song, but it's well done, and I always get a kick out of listening to it. So,you can say this is the most democratic Queen record so far, with good effects. The fact that Freddie and Brian delivered the weakest tracks could be thought of as a bad omen. But no, let's treat the following album not as a bad omen, but as a natural "evolution". Eh?</p>

<p>Well, there's a story that it was Michael Jackson who suggested the band to release Deacon's 'Another One Bites The Dust' as a single. And perhaps their friendship carried Queen towards new paths and horizons. Just to give you an idea, Michael Jackson himself said that this album was an influence on his album <strong>Thriller</strong>. This album isn't just Queen embracing synthesizers; this is Queen digging into the very core of 80's dance-pop, with all the synthetic grooves, airy and spacey production (that's where the title comes from, after all) and huge reverbs that make the drums go "psssh! pssssh! psssssh!", for good or for bad. Probably both. Or neither. Truthfully, this album didn't score too well neither with the dancing crowd nor with the Queen crowd. It kind of stuck there, in the middle. But honestly, I find it difficult to believe that Queen was really taking this stuff seriously. At least Brian, John and Roger, because there are certain spots that convince that the album was used as a display of Freddie's excesses.</p>

<p>For starters, the album is kind of divided in two. There's little of that "dance pop" on the B side, and it is more concentrated on side A. Each member wrote a song on that side, except for Freddie, who contributed two. And it's pretty blatant that it's Freddie who has the wildest approach to the style, fuelling his performances with sexually-driven grunts, hisses and lyrics. Yes, and that's part of the reason why I utterly <em>detest</em> 'Body Language'. Apart from the fact that the synth bass line is only mildly catchy, the whole song is a puddle of blatant attempts at sounding horny. And the music itself is anything but entertaining. Really, I can't stand it, and I can name it as the only Queen song that I ultimately hate. It isn't even campy enough to be funny. Fortunately, 'Staying Power' is driven by a much cooler synth bass line (John would switch to regular guitar instead of his bass) and a funky, groovy synth rhythm punctured by actual brass stabs. Even though it <em>does</em> include the incredibly unfortunate lyric "blow, baby, blow", it does have a couple of cool instrumental breaks and sudden crescendos and stuff, making it a really dynamic, catchy piece. Honest to goodness, I really do like it.</p>

<p>The other members deviate a little from that form with their contributions. Brian's 'Dancer' is essentially a funk/rock fusion with a meaner, stronger rhythm with the usual "spices" thrown in for good measure. It isn't really very impressive, especially when compared to 'Another One Bites The Dust' and 'Dragon Attack'. At least, it's tolerable. John Deacon's contribution is radically removed from Brian's rock sound and goes straight into soul music. And 'Back Chat' is indeed good, and even though Freddie wouldn't be the first person I'd ask to sing a soul song, he keeps relatively restrained and more focused on the melody, instead of his usual acrobatics - though they are still there. And it helps that the song isn't about sex. Same thing happens with Roger's 'Action This Day', who switches into "paranoia mode" with an appropriately tense rhythm and tense vocals and such, only turning into a "we gotta learn to love, to live" message in the chorus. I really like this song, for some reason. I think I like the way its tension contrasts with the rest of the album.</p>

<p>Anyway, judging by the amount of "for some reason, I like this" you see, the rating for this album will be a bit unexplained. But then, what kind of explanation one can give about this album? The best I can do is say what I like and what I don't, because even to this day, the album still baffles me a tad. Fact is that there are some really good songs here. For example, Freddie's piano ballad 'Life Is Real', dedicated to John Lennon, is really beautiful and smart. It predicts his style of grandiose balladry revisited in 'It's A Hard Life' (the titles are a world apart from each other, huh?), and I like this one quite a lot. His collaboration with John, 'Cool Cat' is also great, flowing smoothly with Freddie singing it all in falsetto. Here's a good place to see some of Freddie's fabulous, unusual vocals you don't hear everywhere. Originally, this was going to feature David Bowie, and their aborted collaboration on that track spawned a great hit, the famous 'Under Pressure'. And what can I say? The song remains fantastic even to this day. The combined bass/piano riff is immortal, and so is the great interplay between Freddie's and Bowie's singing, and so are the lyrics:"mmm be bop!", "eee de dap!" and "mmm da da dap!" struck a chord with many people of that day. Okay, I'm sounding sarcastic here, but the song is really great, switching quieter parts with sudden, big crescendos and the climactic "this is our last dance" finale. It's credited to all four members of Queen and David Bowie, and even though it was based on an earlier Roger Taylor song, it's largely Freddie's music and Bowie's lyrics.</p>

<p>I'm not a big fan of the others. Roger's 'Calling All Girls' spreads a message of love in a nice, pleasant but unremarkable way, with poppy acoustic guitars and sticky-sweet melodies. 'Las Palabras De Amor', a tribute to Queen's Latin American fans, is not bad at all, but it kind of pales in comparison to other Queen ballads. And Brian's rocker, 'Put Out The Fire', is an entertaining anti-weapon rant, but I used to like it more than I do now. These tracks don't really make the album worse with their presence, but they end up sounding like dull padding, even though it's hard to say which tracks here are "filler" and which aren't. Maybe there's no filler. Maybe the whole album was sloppily put together to cash in with a different crowd, or it was just a joke. I don't know. I <em>don't know</em>. All I know is that the album doesn't deserve a particularly low grade from me. Why? The hell should I know.</p>

<p>Upon returning, Queen decided to take a step back from <strong>Hot Space</strong> by... dumping the synths? No. Dumping the airy production? Nope. So, what? Basically, they dumped the dance/funk music, and mostly applied Mack's "revamped" production to their usual brand of hard rock, but not quite. Even though there are but nine songs, the album's quite a mixed bowl. No two songs sound like, to everyone's benefit, and there's plenty of goody-goody music with a few small disappointments as well.</p>

<p>Say, May's 'Tear It Up' is pretty much a continuation of the sound of 'Put Out The Fire', and I'm not a big fan of it. The trashy-bashy hard rock sound doesn't do much service to a practically non-existant melody. I'm sorry, I just don't like it much. That's the only "disappointment" I'd name here, though. Of the other songs, I'm kind of bugged by the "socially aware" 'Is This The World We Created?' that closes the album. Look, I don't doubt that Freddie and Brian really worried about those things they say on the song, even if it had been just once in a life time. It just doesn't sound too fit to pop up in Queen's carreer at <em>this</em> point, does it? It just ends up sounding incredibly insincere and maybe even cynical. The music is pretty much designed to sound "poignant", even though Brian's acoustic guitar playing is top notch. It just doesn't feel quite alright, but maybe it's just me.</p>

<p>But Brian doesn't come across as a total disappointment: 'Hammer To Fall' is a really cool, if generic and straightforward, rocker, improving a bit on the 'Now I'm Here' formula. The riff is quite classic, and the steady driving rhythm really keeps things going tight and nice. The other "rocker", so to speak, is his collaboration with Roger Taylor, 'Machines'. It might be quite fun to speculate whether Queen were really being <em>that</em> influenced by Kraftwerk when writing this song, but in fact, it doesn't sound that much like Kraftwerk, aside from Roger's use of the Vocoder. The song employs goofy "industrial" noises into the groovy rhythm and heavy guitar chords, and aside from that,it isn't such an unusual Queen song. I like it, though, since it's catchy and well written. Roger's top moment here, though, isn't on that song. His own 'Radio Ga Ga' became a quite fair Queen hit, and in spite of all the DJ Bobo remixes and all, I really, <em>really</em> like the song. For one, the use of synthesizers and drum machines doesn't get at all in the way of the song; the use of the machines is intelligent, since the song was basically <em>written</em> for that. As such, the crazy hopping bass line and the chilly pad chords don't sound like cheesy additions, but like the very <em>soul</em> of the song. And it's not at all "cold" as you might imagine, if just because the melody and Freddie's delivery is so damn good. I hear complaints about the lyrics being stupid ("All we hear is Radio Ga Ga, Radio Goo Goo"),but when those words were inspired by Roger's little kid, what's there to complain about?</p>

<p>Talk about hits, this album brings one of the band's most unusual, memorable hits ever: John Deacon's 'I Want To Break Free'. It's a typical John pop song, in that it's <em>brilliantly</em> catchy and melodic, and the synthesizer arrangements <em>do</em> get in the way, but in a fun, quirky manner that's very faithful to Queen's style of ambiguous,sideways twists. The gay connotations the song achieved, I suppose, are mainly due to the hilarious video with all four members dressed in drag. The music itself doesn't have anything actually "gay", does it? Oh, well, if we're gonna think about it that carefully, Gloria Gaynor's 'I Will Survive' doesn't either. And what's the matter? Gay or not gay, 'I Want To Break Free' is a heck of a good song and that's what matters to me.</p>

<p>Freddie's compositions are also quite diverse in style. The most, um, unusual one here is 'Keep Passing The Open Windows', which I dislike upon first listens, for whatever bizarre reasons there might be. Maybe because it's a tad overlong. But in essence, it's a speedy, catchy little pop song, if a bit bloated. Notice that that's a different kind of bloated than of 'It's A Hard Life', you know. Like I said on the previous review, this builds on the ballad style of 'Life Is Real', but puffs it up way further with a full blown operatic intro, a fat and bombastic instrumental break and a powerful vocal delivery. It's a very pretty ballad, still, with good piano playing and all that. It's good especially because all that bloated arrangement isn't there to make it sound like it's more important than it is. And its follow up, 'Man On The Prowl', is a downright honest Elvis homage of sorts, with Freddie throwing a really, really entertaining performance. It's as simple and obvious as it could be, but incredibly fun, and featuring a really mean, awesome piano solo at the end.</p>

<p>My goal here, then, is to try to convince you that this album really entertains me that much. Though an 12 isn't a <em>stunning</em> rating, it's surprising for a band that entered into the 80's for good, embracing all the synths and all that... though it wouldn't last. Thing is, perhaps this album deserved a lower rating, but at this point, I'm a bit hardpressed to start judging the merits and innovations of Queen's music in spite of its sheer entertainment value and good songs. At least, it's a nice, short, entertaining Queen album. And the band member portraits on the sleeve were taken in Rio de Janeiro. Hooray for Rock In Rio!</p>

<p>How about it? Queen writes music for the movie <em>Highlander</em>. Fitting enough, innit? "There can be only one," immortality, head-cutting and all. It's true that this album isn't a soundtrack; it's a collection of assorted songs that may or may not have to do with the movie.But even then, having or not anything to do with the movie, several songs here aren't just that good. Really, this album manages to concentrate quite a couple of songs that I couldn't care less for. Gee, it's almost like they ran out of material, <em>badly</em>. As a result, there are some quite limp-sounding love related songs and some dumb electronic experiments. In short, it's the weakest Queen album so far, <em>and</em> my least favourite Queen album ever.</p>

<p>Even still, there are some really good songs in here. Say what you will, but I'm a sucker for 'Friends Will Be Friends', done in "epic" style with synth strings, spacey arrangement of yore and all that. Very good, catchy melody, though! I just really like that melody. That's not the only good song here, though, even though it's my favourite. The two opening tracks are small classics of their own, though I'm not crazy over them. 'One Vision' is a fine, synth-propelled rocker with catchiness aplenty. Brian's riff reminds me a lot of the more generic hard rock excourses like 'Hammer To Fall', but it works well. The title track is more poppy and lightweight. The melody might sound a bit too sirupy, but Freddie delivers it well, and the whole band makes the song succeed. The only fishy thing about those songs are the goofy, echoeing effects happening everywhere, like vocals popping up backwards and whatever the band or the producers felt they should add to make them sound "modern". Not that they detract from the music too much, but taken on their own, they sound goofy, and not in the way Queen used to sound in <strong>A Night At The Opera</strong> and such.</p>

<p>As for <em>actual</em> goofiness, there's the famous <em>Highlander</em> theme 'Princes Of The Universe', which switches between bombastic singing, dissonant guitar work, finger-fiashing solos and a catchy chorus. All that in that good old tradition of packing a dozen different parts on a relatively short song. It's quite a great track, and the "modern" sound actually works! The other famous <em>Highlander</em> song is 'Who Wants To Live Forever', a grandiose, sweeping ballad, in the also good tradition of pomposity and all. Only this is pretty <em>serious</em> sounding, you know, what with the orchestra arrangement, the puffed-up singing and all. It's still good, really memorable.</p>

<p>The other songs, well, I can't call them <em>bad</em>. They're not bad. They're just surprisingly limp and unmemorable to Queen's standards, in a way that no previous Queen song managed to be. I'm serious. Even the most fillerish songs, like 'Sweet Lady', and the more questionable ones, like 'Don't Try Suicide', were at least interesting <em>in a way</em>. I can't say these songs here are really interesting. They're curious, for being quite untypical for Queen, but they just don't have a lot going on. Brian's 'Gimme The Prize' is quite maligned, in fact, though it's far from being the band's worst song. It's one of those hard rocking songs, littered with sound effects from the movie, and not a whole lot of catchiness. I don't hate it, but I don't really like it either. In other words, it doesn't at all contribute to increase the album's rating a bit.</p>

<p>The others <em>are</em> fairly surprised, if only because, like I said, they're untypical. John's 'One Year Of Love' is an adult contemporary romantic ballad unlike <em>any</em> Queen ballad ever written. It's the usual kind of syrupy, FM-friendly tune with slow electronic drums, a sax solo and orchestral arrangements. Yes, <em>just</em> like that. Yet, Freddie manages to pull off a miraculously expressive and memorable vocal performance. It's not like he <em>means</em> this, but his vocals are entertaining, without being serious or over-the-top. Really, in terms of entertainment and adequacy, he's being the anti-Celine Dion here. However, his falsetto gymnastics on the poppy, snappy 'Pain Is So Close To Pleasure' don't do much to me. And in fact, there's just <em>something</em> here that reminds me to the likes of George Michael - the overall mood and rhythm of the song, I believe. There isn't a lot aside from this, and only Brian May arrives with his blessed guitar to save the ending of the song.</p>

<p>The last song is Roger's 'Don't Lose Your Head', a dumb dance pop excourse which I can never remember well. You can take that either as a proof of my lack of interest, or as an indication of the song's lack of memorability. Right, go and say that I don't care about the song, but keep in mind that I once was a raving Queen fanatic. So there. I don't think I need to get so defensive. This is a heck of a weak Queen album, and the least necessary in my collection, to be honest. The best songs here can be found on <strong>Greatest Hits II</strong>, anyway.</p>

<p>Queen kicks back WITH A VENGEANCE. Not exactly. Okay, maybe. Who knows. With a slightly updated production and a handful of really good songs, <strong>The Miracle</strong> was a comeback of sorts for the band, after a small hiatus. And I could make some dumb puns with the album's title, questioning whether it <em>is</em> a miracle or not. I can't say it <em>is</em>, but even though it may not mean a lot, it's a whole lot better than <strong>A Kind Of Magic</strong>.</p>

<p>For one, there's a good quantity of <em>really</em> good songs here, and unlike the <strong>A Kind Of Magic</strong> songs, they pretty much evade completely the traps of "pomposity" or "goofiness" or whatever else. They're perfectly solid songs. Okay, I'll admit that the title track has the dippiest, cheesiest lyrics that Mr. Bad Guy could possibly assemble ("That time will come / One day you'll see / When we can all be friends!"), but at least it <em>does</em> have some nifty and funny passages, like when he places the Hanging Gardens of Babylon right next to Jimi Hendrix as a Wonder of the world. But you see, the song is so <em>self-awarely cheesy</em>, that I can't help but love it. And the music is fun, uplifting, and well written in that good "mini operetta" tradition of Queen, with clever synth arrangements and a fast instrumental section that appears from out of nowhere and disappears beneath the sing-along ending. It's just <em>fun</em>, want it or not.</p>

<p>And if there's one thing this album offers in spades, it's <em>fun</em>. After all, without the <em>need</em> to go over-the-top at every corner, the album's just mainly one big, friendly goof-up, in which none of the songs is really <em>bad</em>. Yes, yes, I'll be a bastard again and complain about Brian May's slow, rockin' songs some more. 'I Want It All' is a classic of sorts, a slow, powerful anthem with a melody so simple it's almost braindead, and I'm not a fan of it. The <em>song</em> itself is not too bad, but all those guitar passages sound awfully contrived and tacked-on, for some reason. And you know there's something wrong when <em>I</em> am complaining about <em>Brian May's</em> guitar passages. It just doesn't fall together very well. 'Scandal', with its 80's guitar/synth riff and drum sound, is a tad more dramatic, dealing with the his relationships with the press and all. It's an okay song, enjoyable enough, and in fact, I like it a bit more than 'I Want It All'.</p>

<p>There are two other songs that I don't care much about, either, but the thing is that they are still enjoyable enough to fit the album without detracting from the really good stuff. John's Caribbean tinged 'Rain Must Fall' is his usual brand of radio-friendly pop, perhaps a bit <em>too</em> harmless, but at least it's not the adult contemporary syrup of 'One Year Of Love', and 'My Baby Does Me' sounds like a <strong>Hot Space</strong> throwback a la 'Cool Cat', which is so dumb sounding that ends up being fun. As for the rest, it's all just fine and dandy. The two opening tracks make a small combo, with 'Party' setting up a dancey rhythm and some funny lines, and brings back all that great Queen energy with synchronised harmonies and rocking guitar parts. Its continuation, 'Khashoggi's Ship', goes towards the hard rocking path, and does a really good job at it! They're just two short tracks, but taken together, they're really good. And form a good opener for the album. Another really fun track is Roger's 'The Invisible Man', which is a sort of retarded kind of fun, but fun nonetheless. It's all about the catchy, infectious beat, and it features one of Brian's flashiest guitar solos, chromatic scales going up and down everywhere. It's always a good choice to show off your instrumental skills in a lighthearted, intentionally dumb pop tune; I mean, who can call you "pretentious" for doing that?</p>

<p>The other Roger song, 'Breakthru', is my favourite in the album. Starting as a completely different song altogether -a piano led gospel-like chant - it kicks into a speedy, catchy and beautiful song that's among Queen's best 80's tracks,in my opinion. It's pretty much as flawless as a pop Queen song can be, though there's nothing particularly <em>impressive</em> with it. The band just performs it well, as if driving a fast smooth car down a highway. Very nice. As for the fans of Mercury's witty songwriting, there's 'Was It All Worth It', which is easily his most, um, "complex" 80's song. The actual content, melody and such, is pretty simple, but the unexpected arrangement twists and exaggerated "orchestral" interludes work wonders with the song's funny, festive atmosphere. The "interludes", in fact, are quite impressively sequenced, as they are entirely synthesized. The final result is a really entertaining song, which does not try to "impress" with its over-the-top arrangements. It's just the good ole tongue-in-cheekiness. In fact, keeping that in mind, you could see this album as a "return to form" of sorts for Queen. But even if it is a return to form, it isn't necessarily a "return to <em>content</em>", if you catch my drift. The music itself just isn't as good as it used to be.But that's just bitching, ya know. At this point, it's a bit comforting to see that the band still had the hang of it, and there <em>was</em> the potential for them to do better things. And so they did.</p>

<p>It gets better. At least that's what <em>I</em> think. And since that's what matters in <em>my</em> site, I can proclaim that this album is an improvement on the former. Yeah, in <em>some</em> aspects. Certainly, this isn't as <em>fun</em> and lighthearted as <strong>The Miracle</strong>. In fact, some parts of it are quite self-counscious and serious, and it isn't such a wild guess to say Freddie Mercury's illness had to do with that. He was aware of it for a few years then, though nobody had made any public statement about it, but he knew it well. And the band knew it well. And there's an air of <em>strangeness</em> in the record that's completely different from anything the band ever did so far. It's not that the humour and the eccentricity are gone completely, but some tracks in the album feel rather chilly,so to speak.</p>

<p>Right from the very <em>first</em> song, the title track, there seems to be a loud announcement about something important. The lyrics are rather cryptic, but you can pick out something interesting about the chants of "we'll keep on trying / 'till the end of time!" on the chorus. And, for one, the band's plodding, heavy, dramatic performance doesn't sound like a statement of pomp for pomp's sake. It's a hella good song, and as if it wasn't enough, the band breaks into a complete non sequitur of a middle break, with an outburst of Flamenco inspired rocking out, synthesized orchestration and some mighty fine Spanish guitar playing by no other than Mr. 'Mood For A Day', Yesman Steve Howe. Needless to say, his playing is pure earcandy, but Brian May does not a worse job with playing that Flamenco riff on his guitar.</p>

<p>That's easily one of Queen's most memorable songs in their late period, and heck, I like it a lot. For one, I don't give a damn if it's over-the-top or anything. It's great, really. As for the rest of the album... well, it's a bit up and down. I can't say this is a <em>consistent</em> album. It isn't, though fortunately, there's nothing that's close to bad. Close to <em>mediocre</em>, yes, but only close. At worst, the songs here are interesting. And at best, they are...well, they are 'I'm Going Slightly Mad', 'I Can't Live With You' and 'The Show Must Go On'. Oh, yes, talk about that: Brian May's songs are all good. <em>Very</em> good, even. Well, okay, I should rephrase that: I like them quite a lot. It's true that no songs are credited to individual members, but it's no use in saying all songs were written by "Queen" at this point, is it? Oh, well. I really, really like Brian's fairly generic, but catchy-as-heck rockers - especially 'I Can't Live With You'. Why? I don't know. Oh, okay, I do know. It's just so happy and uplifting. Call me shallow and superficial, but heck, we all need happy music now and then, and 'I Can't Live With You' is one I'm always glad to listen to. And 'Headlong', with its speedy rhythm, friendly vocals and "hoop diddy-diddy, hoop diddy-doo" choruses is fun, too. As far as the rockers go, Roger's lightning speed 'Ride The Wild Wind' has something unexplainably beautiful about it, with the slow melody clashing against the instruments swirling around. It's another of my favourites here, and another classic Roger Taylor song. And 'The Hitman' is... eh, heavy metal? Or something that <em>sounds</em> like heavy metal but isn't? Whatever it is, it's so dumb and obvious, I can't help but like it. It's not a "guilty pleasure", if you understand me... I'm not quite sure the song is "pleasurable", but it's just funny.</p>

<p>Yes, there <em>are</em> some odd songs in the album, like Freddie's 'Delilah', a song written in homage of one of his housecats. And I love it. After all, we don't hear Queen putting out such lighthearted, dippy synth pop tunes every day,and you <em>know</em> it when three 40+ year old rock stars go "meow!" on the microphone together. And the world needs more songs about cats, be them hilarious like 'Delilah' or menacing like 'Lucifer Sam'. On a more religious tone, there's the <strong>Barcelona</strong> outtake 'All God's People', a Gospel song like no other Gospel song there ever was, for better or for worse. I have to admit this song gets on my nerves sometimes, but when I'm in the mood for it, it's absolutely delightful - especially when Freddie goes into that "yes, there was this magic li-hi-hi-hight!" blues interlude. There's nothing better than that. And nothing worse than that, naturally. And on a more understated note, 'Bijou' is a near-instrumental collaboration between Freddie and Brian, with the latter laying down a beautiful, plaintive guitar solo over a quiet, plaintive keyboard backing. It's a heck of a beautiful guitar performance, indeed, and Freddie only sings a few verses in the middle break - as if the vocals were the "solo" and the guitar were the "singing". Get that? Huh? Clever.</p>

<p>Oh, well, so far everything's silly and fun for a supposedly "dark" and "strange" record, huh? Well, Freddie hints at that strangeness for the first time with the dark-humoured 'I'm Going Slightly Mad', one heck of a clever and well-written pop song with all sorts of weird bass sounds and synthe arrangements, as well as a "multi guitar solo" of sorts,which really does justice to Brian May's cleverness. The ballad 'Don't Try So Hard' is considerably more serious, with a strangely dark musical background for an "uplifting message" song. Oh, well, who knows. I'm not such a big fan of it, but it's nice, and displays some more of Freddie's falsetto singing. As far as ballads go, 'These Are The Days Of Our Lives' is far more beautiful, haunting and moving, with a Latin tinge that doesn't feel fake, and a performance that's just marvellous. Heck, this might be one of my favourite Queen ballads ever, if only it sounds so downright <em>honest</em>. Really.</p>

<p>So much for honesty. If the album is opened with a "bombastic" track, so it is closed. The difference is that 'The Show Must Go On' has that flavour of insincere over-the-topness, though that's also subjective. But either way, it's an eerie way to finish an album that was clearly a swan song of sorts. And in the end, the insincerity doesn't matter - it's memorable and well written, and fulfills its role nicely. What's there to complain about? Not much, really. Overall, I really like the album, in spite of it being considerably "heavier" than I'd expect from a Queen album. And yes, it <em>is</em> a bit depressing to know that the band and Freddie were aware that they wouldn't last for too long. But I'm not here to make cheesy "tributes" to Freddie Mercury, am I? Fact is, I'm a fan of the guy, as a songwriter, as a singer, as an overall musician and player. It's a shame that he had to die like that, but his legacy is right there, for everyone to see, so we can only be thankful for that. How different would the world be without Freddie Mercury? Isn't it a bit scary to think about that? So let's not. Let's just enjoy this band. And this album. Good album. Good band. Great music. God bless those fellas.</p>

<p>At last, Brian, John, Roger and producer David Williams put out the album that the whole world expected anxiously: a collection of spare Queen outtakes! So, the band <em>did</em> have some assorted songs lying on the shelves: either half-finished projects or songs the band had been working on shortly before Freddie's death. And they had... quite a <em>few</em> of those songs, so they decided to make up song outtakes to fill in the gaps. What do I mean? Well, there are a few songs from solo albums, here; namely Freddie's 'Made In Heaven' and 'I Was Born To Love You', Brian's 'Too Much Love Will Kill You' and Roger's 'Heaven For Everyone'. In here, they're given full band treatments and the usual Freddie vocals. The final result is... ehm, well, let's go by parts.</p>

<p>Firstly, the album has quite a bit of that "half unfinished" thing about it. Even though Freddie didn't stop recording vocals until only a few weeks before his death, there are a few unrecorded bits, and in order to fill those gaps, the band and the producer had to recycle single bits of singing several times, and even borrow some from previous albums. Not that that's any horrible problem, of course. But then again, there's <em>quite</em> a bit of empty space filling in here, and it makes me wonder whether they really did have that much material to fill up an album with. I won't try to answer that, really. All I know is that there are exactly six new songs here (I'm not counting the reprise of 'It's A Beautiful Day' as a "new song", and 'My Life Has Been Saved' isn't even properly new, and I'm counting it in). Fortunately, they ain't bad songs at all. I'll talk about them later on, of course.</p>

<p>The re-recorded solo songs vary in my personal preference a bit. For one, I don't like at all the band's rendition of Brian May's 'Too Much Love Will Kill You'. The original was a dippy, cheesy piano ballad with orchestral arrangements, but it was kinda pleasant, you know; inoffensive enough to be pleasant. And for some reason, they switched it into a power ballad here. Freddie's delivery is great, of course, but the rest of the performance doesn't fit in very well with me, for some reason. I don't know, I just can't bring myself to like it. I admit, I <em>do</em> like the original rendition more than a bit, so maybe that's the reason. The other renditions are dandy fine, though. For one, I <em>love</em> 'Heaven For Everyone'. It's a Roger Taylor song released in an album of his band The Cross, but it was Freddie who sang on that version, and so it is on here. I love the song, and the band's performance does it justice. It's one of my favourite tracks on the record, in fact. As for Freddie's solo songs, the title track is a great song and will always be, with its catchy vocal melody and the "thunderous" riff that leads into the verses. The only thing that bothers me about this recording is the way the instruments drown the drums completely at some points (same happens with 'Mother Love'), though that has to do more with the production than with the playing. It's still a heck of a song. I'm not such a fan of the romantic "ballad" 'I Was Born To Love You', but it's in no way offensive. It's just alright, and there's nothing wrong with the band's performance.</p>

<p>Anyway, the new songs reveal a couple of neat surprises, and some not-so-neat surprises. There are no bad songs here,but some tracks are really quite... strange. Take the eerie, gloomy 'Mother Love', for example. Very unusual Queen song,what with those dramatic, loud passages, and an ending with strange sounds flashing by (among them an extract of 'Going Back', recorded by Freddie as "Larry Lurex"). I don't find it a very remarkable song, honestly. And once again, the "half-finishedness" of it shows, as Freddie was unable to record the final verse, so it's sung by Brian here. 'Let Me Live' is a finer, Gospelish pop tune with a friendly choir helping along and with the three singers doing lead vocals, one verse each - which is a trick they hadn't done so far. Really neat song, that one. And I also like John's 'My Life Has Been Saved', which was a B-side from 1989, and here is given a new arrangement. It's a pleasant, non-outstanding piano ballad, which I like quite a bit. The strangest thing here, though, is 'You Don't Fool Me', a catchy 90's dance tune which was actually <em>put together from spare bits and pieces</em> by producer David Richards. And heck, it doesn't sound like it. Call me weird, but the song delights me, repetitive as hell as it is, and I couldn't care <em>less</em> if it wasn't written beforehand; Richards's work here is quite impressive, and the final result is great - much better than most stuff in <strong>Hot Space</strong> could have been, even.</p>

<p>Talking about strangeness, I obviously can't go without talking about the end of the record. 'It's A Beautiful Day', an introspective, beautiful orchestral ballad that opens the record, is reprised as a fast, tension building "wind up" of the whole album, flashing by with guitar solos, extracts of both versions of 'Seven Seas Of Rhye' and samples of Freddie going "No one's gonna stop me now!" etc., and bumps suddenly into the "secret tracks". Track 12 is a four second snippet of the song coming to a screeching halt and a "yeah!" nicked straight from 'Action This Day' (!), and track 13 is a twenty-two minute long ambient piece. Yes, serious. It pretty much extends on the D chord of 'It's A Beautiful Day', going on some looping patterns faintly reminescent of Tangerine Dream, and into some odd, eerie sections featuring small snippets of speech by Freddie. It's up to you whether you think it's a random synth experiment, or a way to fill up the album to the 70 minute mark, or a beautiful way to represent Freddie's journey to Heaven (I've <em>read</em> about that interpretation somewhere, really, I'm not making it up). Me, I'm not bothered by its presence, but I hardly ever listen to it. It's not a bad ambient track, at all, but I'd probably prefer to listen to Tangerine Dream themselves rather than a Tangerine Dream soundalike Queen song, if you get my drift.</p>

<p>The one song I utterly love, here, is 'A Winter's Tale', Freddie's final ballad. It's just beautiful, and the music conveys the message of the lyrics perfectly. Freddie's delivery shines, too, but it might be just an impression of mine that his voice sounds somewhat <em>weary</em> already. But that doesn't hurt at all the performance. It's a gorgeous song; great melody, great atmosphere and everything that goes with it. It would have even been a fabulous way to close the album, if the three closing tracks weren't there. They kind of give the album a bit of that "dead person album" feel, if you know what I mean. Perhaps the album <em>is</em> a bit exploitative, as a whole, but I'm not offended by it.After all, there <em>is</em> good material here, and overall, it's not one of Queen's weakest albums. It's average. I like it, but I'll understand it if you don't.</p>
