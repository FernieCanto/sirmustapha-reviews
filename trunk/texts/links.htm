<h1>
    Links!!
</h1>

<p>This is the page where I reserve myself the right to contribute to this huge cobweb we know as "Internet". The sites you'll find here are either sites that I constantly visit for certain reasons, or places that deserve your attention 'cause they're very good. Feel free to explore the World Wide Maze and find somewhere to waste your time.</p>

<h2 class="rambling">Music related:</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.midicorner.hpg.com.br/">Sir Mustapha's MIDI Corner</a> - Heh heh, talk about self-promotion. This is a website owned by me, where you'll find a big collection of music composed by - ahem - me, all on MIDI format. There is plenty of original material available, so give it a look.</p>

<p><a href="http://ferniecanto.imdanet.com/">Sir Mustapha's Hall Of Music</a> - Just as I have my compositions available on MIDI format, I have my albums fully recorded and available on MP3 format here! Now you can download them and burn them on CD and enjoy them and show them to your friends, or whatever. There is a third album available there, <strong>Concerto Schizophrenia II: "Buses"</strong>, that couldn't make it into MIDI, so go grab that one!</p>

<p>I would include the link to George Starostin's reviews website, but the man has removed his site from the Internet for his own, personal reasons, but we're hoping to see him back in the business before too long.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.markprindle.com/">Mark Prindle's Rock And Roll Record Review Site</a> - Mark is the guy who <em>started</em> this whole "Web Reviewing Community", with his rating system and completely uncompromised writing. The guy's style is unique: as far as music is concerned, he talks short and to-the-point, fearlessly stating his opinion, and adorning it with his unexpected, zany, insulting, gross and hard-hitting sense of humour. Just because of that, I wouldn't recommend this site for the faint of the heart - not <em>only</em> for Mark's writing, but for the crazy "reader comments" he posts on the pages. But his writing is funny and highly enjoyable. He has created a method to allow the readers to vote for what artists they want to see reviewed next, so go there quickly before it's too late!</p>

<p><a href="http://students.imsa.edu/~stoo">John McFerrin's Rock and Prog Reviews</a> - John is a dude that, just like me, decided to start his own reviews site, being faithful pupil of George Starostin (and Mark Prindle, on a minor scale). The website is fairly small (there are something like 25 artists reviewed currently - more than me, though), and it doesn't grow too fast, but it's a worthy place to visit. John has a very, um, "restrained" and polite style, and focuses almost <em>solely</em> on the music, making his reviews very informative. I'm putting the link on here because that was the <em>first</em> reviews website I've ever visited, and I have a special care for this guy. Give him support, will ya?</p>

<p><a href="http://members.lycos.co.uk/wrcwebring/">The Web Reviewing Community</a> - This is the Webring of the Reviewing sites. Along with the "major" sites I've mentioned above, you'll find several others (including mine), and many of they are worthy of a visit.</p>

<h2 class="rambling">Artist related:</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.rzweb.net/">RzWeb</a> - Hands down, the <em>best</em> website for people interested in the work of The Residents. The site was created by a fan, and now, it has become the Official Residents website - and for a reason. There is <em>nothing</em> about the band you won't find on here.</p>

<p><a href="http://tubular.net/">Tubular.net</a> - Another fansite, but this time, dedicated to Mike Oldfield. The site contains <em>too much</em> stuff to mention in one paragraph, but suffice to say, if you like Mike, Tubular.net is a mandatory stop. They even have a Forum, open to the public. Needless to say, I'm a member.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.enoweb.co.uk/">EnoWeb</a> - Website dedicated to the works of master Brian Eno, with very useful information for novices <em>and</em> veterans. Includes complete discography, an "info centre", interviews, galleries, and even discussions about Eno's lyrics.</p>

<h2 class="rambling">Non-music related:</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.simpworks.com/">The Groening FanWorks Central</a> - I have no fear in proclaiming that <em>this</em> is the absolutely best <em>Simpsons</em> and <em>Futurama</em> fanfiction website you'll find. The site has a "community" that frequents the discussion board, but anyone can submit their fanfiction or fanart, and if it's quality work, it will be accepted. Also, the members will give you any advice you need to improve and enhance your skills. If you really like Matt Groening's cartoons, that website is a <em>must</em>... Needless to say, I <em>am</em> a member of the website, and you can normally find me there under the nickname of "Mr Snake".</p>

<p><a href="http://www.southparkstudios.com/games/create.html">South Park Create-A-Character</a> - This is where you'll find the Character Creator I used to make the South Park figures of the artists reviewed here. Fun stuff!</p>

<p><a href="http://nerdsofprey.imdanet.com/">Nerds Of Prey</a> - Sheana (pronounced Shay-na) Molloy (pronounced Six-six-six), member of the aforementioned Groening FanWorks Central and devoted fan of The Who, created this webcomic inspired by the life of her and her friends. Being a first rate artist and a good humourist, Sheana combines both skills in her webcomic, and if you enjoy this kind of stuff (or not), give her a visit. She deserves it. <span class="edNote">Now gimme the money, Sheana.</span></p>

<p><a href="http://www.snopes.com/">Snopes.com</a> - According to one of my pals, this is one of those websites that you can spend hours on, just going from link to link. And I wholeheartedly agree. For the uninitiated, this is a site entirely devoted to "Urban Legends", where Barbara and David Mikkelson talk about hundreds, or thousands of "myths" and "popular beliefs", clarifying whether they are true or not. Is it harmful to swim after you eat? Was Fanta created by Nazis? Was the image of Santa Claus as we know him created by Coca-Cola? Check it out for yourself!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> - And this is another of those websites. Wikipedia is "The Free Encyclopaedia", containing many thousands of entries about diverse topics in several languages. Great design and interface, a wonderful website, indeed. This is what the Internet is all about!</p>
