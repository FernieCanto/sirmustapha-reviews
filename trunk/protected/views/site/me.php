<h2>About the Author</h2>

<p>I'll try not to overstay my welcome.</p>

<p>I was born in August 1985, in the sourthernmost state of Brazil. My native 
   language, like that of most people born in this country, is Portuguese, 
   <em>NOT Spanish</em>. I was your usually "shy, inwards kid" who had a crap 
   life in school but a fairly good one outside it. My family was a fairly poor 
   one, but we lived decently and with dignity, and due to my father's bizarre 
   notions about finances, we had such things as a beach house and a computer. I 
   pretty much grew up in front of the computer, and I was 5 or 6 years old when 
   I amused myself by programming in BASIC (for me it was just a toy). In the 
   mid-late 90's we went online, but it was only much time later that I learned 
   to use it properly (no, not for porn, you bastard!... that was much later).</p>

<p>I was also a kid when my parents discovered I had a quite extraordinary 
   aptitude for music. Well, that's what other people said; basically what I did 
   was learn to play tunes by ear on a toy piano, and my father (again, bizarre 
   finantial notions) encouraged me to play the keyboards and take a course. 
   That was when I figured out that I <em>really</em> liked music &mdash; not as 
   much <em>playing</em> it as enjoying it and learning about it. With the aid 
   of the Internet, I started to get heavily into my "first bands" &mdash; 
   starting with Queen, checking out Jean Michel Jarre, moving on to progressive 
   rock acts such as Rush, Yes and King Crimson, and so on and on. Yes, my 
   primary channel for learning about music was the Internet. Along the way, I 
   started to experiment with writing music using MIDI authoring software on the 
   computer. It took about 8 years of being total crap before I decided to try 
   to be actually good about it &mdash; I said <em>try to</em>, play close 
   attention!.</p>

<p>In terms of studying and working, I have always been in the field of Computer 
   Science, and I work as a programmer. Music, however, has always been a very 
   strong interest of mine, but I never undertook it professionally. I write and 
   record music on my personal computer and release it for free, under the 
   Creative Commons, on <a href="http://ferniecanto.imdanet.com">my music 
   website</a>. As for the idea of reviewing albums, I was motivated by older 
   and more well consolidated independent reviewers such as John McFerrin (who I 
   came to meet through the Rush board from the long deceased 
   <em>AudioGalaxy</em>, when an outraged fan linked to his Rush page and the 
   whole board condemned him for not explicitly calling Geddy Lee the Second 
   Coming of the Messiah), Mark Prindle and George Starostin. My page was 
   <em>extremely</em> amateurish and hosted on &mdash; gasp! &mdash; Geocities!! 
   Eventually I sort of got the hang of it and my size grew quite generously. As 
   I was during the process to convert it into a little PHP system, with the 
   reviews stored in a MySQL database to avoid errors and inconsistencies in the 
   site, the server my site was hosted in crashed and I lose my account. So, my 
   site was wiped off, and I got out of the reviewing business... until now, of 
   course.</p>

<p>Truly, I love writing. If you let me, I'll write on and on about any topic. 
   And since music interests me greatly, yeah, I write about it a lot. And also, 
   I <em>like</em> to rationalise the listening process. It's my favourite way 
   of making music. As you can read it on my
   <?=CHtml::link('principles', array('site/principles'))?> page, that doesn't mean I 
   am not emotionally affected by music, but yes, I am very rational and I like
   to talk about it. That crap about "dancing about architecture"? Forget that 
   shit, and if you ever read it attributed to Frank Zappa, don't believe that.
   Zappa never said it; he did say that "Rock journalism is people who can't 
   write interviewing people who can't speak for people who can't read". But 
   anyway, reviews for me are a truly fun activity and a diversion... and I like 
   to keep my stuff categorised, too. No, I don't use the 5 stars rating thing 
   on my Winamp library, as that would be pushing it a little too hard. Besides,
   5 possible ratings? That's just <em>too limiting</em>, and I'd end up with a 
   huge mass of 5's and 4's that eventually wouldn't mean anything at all.</p>

<p>But anyway. Since the time my old site fell down, I grew to become quite a 
   lot more eclectic than before. I was already quite open to different things, 
   but now, I absolutely refuse to disregard a genre or refuse something just 
   because of a label. True, some genres don't interest me as much as others, 
   but if I were to strive for a 100% perfect balance, I'd drive myself crazy, 
   right? So, yeah, I listen to pretty much everything. Also, I ceased to be the 
   rabid Simpsons fan I used to be, and I'm quite embarrassed of some of the 
   crap I used to write. So, if you see anything associating me to any Lisa 
   Simpson fandom, disregard it; I'm way past that. I am now an actual employee, 
   instead of a poor intern, so my finantial situation has become much more 
   stable and tranquil than before. And to top all of that, I started a solid 
   relationship with an ex-coworker of mine, which lasts to this day and is 
   slowly leading itself towards marriage. In case I haven't made myself clear 
   enough, that last one is the most important change of all.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy your stay, and I won't take more of your time with just 
   myself. Go on and enjoy the rest of the website. It's all free (for you and 
   me, at least)</p>
